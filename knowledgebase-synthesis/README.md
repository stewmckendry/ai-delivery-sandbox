# Knowledgebase Document Synthesis PoC

## Objective
Use GPT connectors to extract and synthesize content from internal knowledge sources (e.g. SharePoint, Teams, emails) to generate high-quality business documents.

## Target Audience
Business operations, strategy, and compliance teams.

## Hypothesis
By mining internal communication and documentation, we can draft strategic documents with minimal manual input.

## Inputs
- Simulated SharePoint pages, Teams chats, or email dumps

## Flow
1. Connect to data source (or simulate access with local files)
2. Query for relevant content
3. Instruct GPT to structure into:
   - Strategy documents
   - Audit reports
   - Project plans

## Output
Draft document with clear structure, citations, and summarization

## Notes
PoC can begin with local markdown/text files representing internal content.
