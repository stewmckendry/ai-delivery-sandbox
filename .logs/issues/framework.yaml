  title: YAML grounding file committed with incorrect or missing content
  detail: During task 1.5_research_spikes, the YAML grounding file at project/inputs/knowledgebooks/youth_career_guide.yaml
    was committed without actual YAML content. This caused downstream issues when
    ProductPod attempted to use the data.
  suggested_fix: Enhance commit verification to validate content structure before
    committing YAML. Add a pre-commit YAML schema lint or basic presence check for
    key root elements like 'careers:'.

  title: Monolithic YAML commit fails silently due to content size or overwrite behavior
  detail: During task 1.5_research_spikes, a full YAML file with 50+ structured career
    entries failed to commit properly. The system either truncated or overwrote the
    YAML on each commit attempt without appending, leading to data loss.
  suggested_fix: Introduce content size checks or enforce segmentation when committing
    structured data. Consider appending-only logic or YAML merge helpers for large
    grounding files.
