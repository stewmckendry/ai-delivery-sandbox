  title: ways_of_working.md content redacted on first commit
  detail: When committing the final output for the Ways of Working task, the file
    content was mistakenly replaced with a summary string instead of the full document.
    This caused the committed file to be incomplete.
  suggested_fix: Update commit automation logic to ensure the full document content
    (not just a summary or metadata) is passed to the commit API. Add validation to
    catch content truncation or mismatch before finalizing the commit.
