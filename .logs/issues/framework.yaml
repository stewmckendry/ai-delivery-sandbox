  title: YAML grounding file committed with incorrect or missing content
  detail: During task 1.5_research_spikes, the YAML grounding file at project/inputs/knowledgebooks/youth_career_guide.yaml
    was committed without actual YAML content. This caused downstream issues when
    ProductPod attempted to use the data.
  suggested_fix: Enhance commit verification to validate content structure before
    committing YAML. Add a pre-commit YAML schema lint or basic presence check for
    key root elements like 'careers:'.
