  title: ways_of_working.md content redacted on first commit
  detail: When committing the final output for the Ways of Working task, the file
    content was mistakenly replaced with a summary string instead of the full document.
    This caused the committed file to be incomplete.
  suggested_fix: Update commit automation logic to ensure the full document content
    (not just a summary or metadata) is passed to the commit API. Add validation to
    catch content truncation or mismatch before finalizing the commit.

  title: Commit tool redacts full file content when 'content' includes placeholder
    strings
  detail: When committing updated content, if the 'content' field includes a placeholder
    like '[updated content goes here]' or '[Full document...]', the system treats
    it as literal and commits redacted or incomplete content. This caused multiple
    rounds of recommits and could lead to silent data loss.
  suggested_fix: Add validation to detect placeholder patterns in content fields before
    commit. Log warnings or errors when placeholders are detected and block commit
    if unresolved.
