  title: Missing 'uvicorn' in requirements.txt
  detail: Railway build failed because 'uvicorn' is not installed. It is required

  title: Missing TrackerMetadata model in db_models.py
  detail: log_incident_detail.py tries to log triage metadata using a model called
    TrackerMetadata, but this model does not exist in db_models.py. This breaks import
    and database integration.
  suggested_fix: Define TrackerMetadata model in db_models.py to match log structure.
    Update import and DB writer to align.

  title: 500 Error on export_summary for user_ey_bulldogs_001
  detail: The /export_summary endpoint returns a 500 error when invoked with user_id
    'user_ey_bulldogs_001'. Logs indicate an unhandled ExceptionGroup in ASGI application
    during response generation, likely in PDF or FHIR export routines.
  suggested_fix: Trace through export_summary tool for potential missing or malformed
    data in DB queries, PDF generation, or FHIR bundle construction. Add more granular
    error handling and logging around those components.
