  title: Missing 'uvicorn' in requirements.txt
  detail: Railway build failed because 'uvicorn' is not installed. It is required
    for the server startup but not included in the project's requirements.txt.

  title: Missing TrackerMetadata model in db_models.py
  detail: log_incident_detail.py tries to log triage metadata using a model called
    TrackerMetadata, but this model does not exist in db_models.py. This breaks import
    and database integration.
  suggested_fix: Define TrackerMetadata model in db_models.py to match log structure.
    Update import and DB writer to align.
