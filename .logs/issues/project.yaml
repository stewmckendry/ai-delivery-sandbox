  title: Batch 4 commits partially failed without clear error
  detail: During commit of Batch 4 (fetch_summary feature), the initial commit call
    succeeded only for memory.py, while the remaining files (schemas/summary.py, utils/memory_manager.py,
    clients/airtable_client.py) were not committed despite no explicit error being
    returned. Required manual re-commits. Possibly due to context overrun or file
    buffer handling during bulk updates.
  suggested_fix: Verify commit payload size limits or logging around batch commits
    to ensure atomicity or return more descriptive error messaging.
