### 🧠 Reengineering the GPT Delivery Framework – Learnings from Tool Fixing Phase

#### 📌 Context
After extensive discovery, planning, and feature implementation phases, we entered a rigorous tool validation and enhancement phase. This revealed foundational gaps in our AI-native app delivery model—especially in how we design for GPT tooling, validate interactions, and iterate quickly without losing structure.

This document reflects on those experiences and proposes key shifts to our software delivery lifecycle (SDLC).

### 🔍 Why So Many Fixes Were Needed
Despite completing design and development:
- GPTs were misunderstanding schema fields, instructions, and payloads.
- Input/output expectations were unclear or overly open-ended.
- Many tools relied on implicit state or required inferred inputs that weren’t documented or enforced.
- Schemas were under-specified, lacked examples, or weren’t tested against actual GPT responses.

These problems were systemic—not code bugs, but breakdowns in the interface between intent (design) and behavior (GPT interaction).

### 🧠 Mindset Shift: Building AI-Native Means Testing With AI
We’ve treated testing as a later stage. But GPT is not like a human QA—it interprets instructions, schema, and OpenAPI nuance to produce structured tool calls. That means:
- Every change must be **validated via real GPT behavior**.
- If a schema is ambiguous, GPTs will misinterpret it.
- If prompts are long or unclear, GPTs will shortcut logic.
- If state is assumed but not explicit, GPTs won’t carry it across steps.

🔁 **Building for AI = Designing and testing with AI, early and often.**

### 🧱 Process Gaps
1. **Too Linear:** Discovery ➝ Design ➝ Dev ➝ Test doesn’t reflect how GPT logic emerges.
2. **Too Isolated:** Schema, logic, flow, and memory live in different files, owned by different pods.
3. **Too Fragile:** Changes to schema or one tool often ripple across others, but there’s no system to catch it.
4. **Too Manual:** The Human Lead has to remember to commit, test, fetch, interpret, and QA everything.

---

### 🔨 Structural Fixes
1. **Design-Test Loops per Tool**
   - Use a standard flow: `design + write schema ➝ test GPT behavior ➝ refine ➝ validate end-to-end`
   - Commit test scenarios per tool (e.g., `test_assess_concussion_gpt.yaml`)

2. **Schema-Driven Development**
   - Tools should be written against the OpenAPI contract first, not retrofitted.
   - GPT instructions must include examples and translation rules (e.g., convert symptoms to symptom_id).

3. **Modular Ownership**
   - Each tool or feature should be its own module with:
     - A clear owner
     - Defined inputs/outputs
     - Known dependencies (what it requires or affects)

4. **Artifact Anchoring**
   - Every artifact should point to a task + tool.
   - Every tool should have a `tool_contract.md`, `schema.md`, and test logs.

5. **Human + Pod Routines**
   - Human Lead sets goal, context, and tasks.
   - Pod:
     - Fetches latest files
     - Plays back understanding
     - Plans batch
     - Tests iteratively and logs learnings
     - Commits + documents

### 🛠️ Tooling Needs
- 🔁 Schema Tester: Validate schema + instructions with real GPT calls.
- 🔎 Coverage Scanner: Detect missing test or docs for tools.
- 🧩 Memory Indexer: Search for example payloads or relevant logic by tool.

---

### 🧩 Example: Triage Flow Fixes
- Introduced `skip_if` logic to allow conditional skips.
- Added `mode` clarification probes.
- Refined schema with clearer instructions.
- Improved symptom logging fidelity.

These changes dramatically improved usability—but required **tool handler edits + schema updates + instructions + test case replays**. All interconnected.

---

### 🚀 What To Do Next
- Bake this design–test–fix loop into **every feature task**.
- Treat schema + test as **core artifacts**, not add-ons.
- Expect every tool to need refinement after initial GPT testing.
- Reduce handoffs—tie schema, test, and tool to one accountable pod.

We’re building the pipeline for AI-native delivery—our SDLC must reflect the actual loop GPTs operate in. Let’s make it visible, modular, and test-driven from the start.
