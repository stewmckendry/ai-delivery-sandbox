backlog:
  - id: ENH-001
    title: Add task granularity and validation guides
    description: Support better task decomposition with modular templates and validation prompts.
    background: Vague or high-context tasks such as "define delivery flow" led to inconsistent outputs across pods.
    impact: Misaligned assumptions, increased rework, reduced reuse.
    replication: Assign a cross-functional task without input/output scaffolding.
    affected_elements: [task_templates, chain_of_thought.yaml, prompt editor]
    attachments: ["project/outputs/1.3_break_into_features/chain_of_thought.yaml"]
    priority: high

  - id: ENH-002
    title: Introduce prompt templates and QA tools
    description: Provide pre-built prompt formats and automatic diagnostics.
    background: Prompt quality varied significantly due to lack of structure.
    impact: Poor GPT outputs, role confusion, low reusability.
    replication: Write a new prompt from scratch with no guidance.
    affected_elements: [prompt creation tool, template library, prompt metadata schema]

  - id: ENH-003
    title: Improve handoff continuity across pods
    description: Standardize richer handoff note structure and CoT snapshots.
    background: Pods repeatedly reestablished context, slowing flow.
    impact: Loss of knowledge, redundant reasoning, misaligned outputs.
    replication: Transition from research > prompt creation without structured handoff.

  - id: ENH-004
    title: Add protections for file overwrite on task completion
    description: Introduce write-locks or filename suffixes to prevent overwrites.
    background: Task completions with overlapping outputs caused silent data loss.
    impact: Broken chain_of_thoughts, unclear ownership of results.
    replication: Complete 2 tasks with same output file path.

  - id: ENH-005
    title: Build simplified UX for non-technical personas
    description: Enable goal-first navigation, highlight actions and summaries.
    background: Non-technical users found prompt crafting and outcome reviews challenging.
    impact: Low engagement, errors in handoffs.
    replication: Ask a non-technical user to interpret a CoT or prompt from scratch.

  - id: ENH-006
    title: Add task dependency visualizer
    description: Display task relationships and progress to support coordination.
    background: Gaps and overlaps in pod tasking reported in retrospectives.
    impact: Blocked pods, duplicated work.
    replication: Assign tasks to multiple pods for the same user goal without coordination.
    affected_elements: [task planner, dependency mapper]

  - id: ENH-007
    title: Auto-summarize phase insights
    description: Automatically synthesize phase results into accessible digests.
    background: Key patterns and learnings were trapped in unstructured YAML.
    impact: Lost learning, missed reuse.
    replication: Search for prior strategies across multiple YAML files.
    affected_elements: [summary generator, digest publisher]

  - id: BUG-001
    title: Resolve commit lifecycle bugs
    description: Fix silent commit failures and improve error handling for YAML size or overwrite cases.
    background: Large YAMLs silently failed to commit; files overwritten with no warning.
    impact: Broken task outputs, inaccurate history.
    replication: Attempt to commit oversized YAML or re-commit to same path.

  - id: BUG-002
    title: Improve reliability of Railway deploy hooks
    description: Patch deploy lifecycle hooks to handle failures or race conditions.
    background: Broken state during batch commits affected live updates.
    impact: Partial deploys, stale state.
    replication: Complete multiple tasks with parallel commits.
