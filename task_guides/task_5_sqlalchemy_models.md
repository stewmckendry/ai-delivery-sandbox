- Use declarative base in `db.py` with engine + `Base.metadata.create_all()`
- Configure SQLite in-memory or file-based DB for testing

## âœ… What to Report Back
- File paths and full content
- Test script or code block to initialize DB and insert sample data
- Unit test that validates table creation and data insertion
- Output of test run (e.g., pytest or inline test)
