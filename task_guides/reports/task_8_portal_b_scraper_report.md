# Task 8 Review: Portal B Scraper

## ✅ Summary
Agent implemented a second portal adapter using Playwright that:
- Logs into Portal B via `#username`, `#password`, and `button.login-btn`
- Navigates post-login and saves dashboard HTML to `/tmp/portal_b_dashboard.html`
- Downloads up to 3 PDF files to `/tmp/`
- Returns a list of file paths and metadata

## 📂 File Created
- `app/adapters/portal_b.py`

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python app/adapters/portal_b.py --username USER --password PASS --url https://portal.url
```
Expected output: file paths and download metadata

## ✅ Compilation
```bash
python -m py_compile app/adapters/portal_b.py
```

## ❌ Testing in Agent
- Skipped due to Playwright and httpx not installable in agent runtime

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Clean implementation with CLI support and async logic
- ✅ Correct layout handling (alternative selectors)
- 🟡 Next steps: robust error handling, edge case resilience

## 🔁 Next Step
Ready for integration with file store and metadata service.
