# Task 32 Review: Store AI-Extracted Records from ETL Pipeline

## ✅ Summary
Stores `final_records` output from the LLM-based extractor and cleaner into a new `structured_records` table in SQLite.

## 📂 Files Updated
- `app/storage/models.py` – adds `StructuredRecord`
- `app/storage/structured.py` – insert helper
- `app/orchestrator.py` – appends call to insert structured records
- `tests/test_structuring.py` – includes insert test
- `tests/test_orchestrator.py` – confirms ETL writes cleaned output

## 🗃️ Table Schema
```sql
id, portal, type, text, source_url, date_created
```

## 🧪 Tests
```bash
pytest -q
```
- ✅ Confirmed 2+ records inserted
- ✅ Verified text + type fields match inputs

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Modular, clean, and DB-compatible
- ✅ Final_records now persist across runs
- 🟡 Optionally query by portal/type for export/RAG next

## 🚀 Full AI record retention is now complete – ready for summarization or export
