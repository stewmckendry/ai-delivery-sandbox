# Task 23 Review: Delegation Token + Identity-Aware Proxy

## ✅ Summary
Describes and prototypes a mechanism for secure, short-lived access delegation using signed tokens, avoiding raw credential reuse.

## 📂 Files
- `app/auth/token.py`
- `docs/design/delegation_token_flow.md`

## 🔐 Architecture Summary
- Users consent to portal access
- A short-lived, signed token is generated
- The AI agent presents this token to an identity-aware proxy
- The proxy creates a session and mediates access to the portal

## 🔁 Integration
- Could replace credential use **if** the portal accepts tokens or SSO
- In most cases, supplements existing credential management
  - Credentials initiate access
  - Token maintains session delegation for the AI

## ⚙️ Utility Behavior (`token.py`)
- Creates signed, URL-safe tokens with:
  - user ID, agent ID, portal, expiry
- Verifies token integrity and expiration

## 🧪 Test
```bash
pytest -q  # Validates token creation + validation
```

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Clear token structure, signing logic, and short lifespan
- ✅ Secure against tampering (HMAC w/ secret)
- 🟡 Future: rotate secrets, support JWT claims, optional OAuth flow

## 🔮 Application
- Use token to start/recover session between steps
- Token can replace credentials in session handoff to automation script

## 🚀 Ready for staged integration into credential lifecycle
