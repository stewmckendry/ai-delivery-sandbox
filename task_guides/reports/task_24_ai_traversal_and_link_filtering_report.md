# Task 24 Review: AI-Powered Traversal and Link Filtering

## ✅ Summary
Implemented a link scoring and crawling engine to prioritize and visit internal pages likely to contain relevant content.

## 📂 Files
- `app/crawler.py`
- `tests/test_crawler.py`

## 🔁 Behavior
- Extracts anchor links from HTML using BeautifulSoup
- Scores links by anchor text and URL path (e.g., "lab", "download", ".pdf")
- Traverses links with breadth-first search up to a given limit
- Avoids revisiting pages; tracks visited and queued

## 🧪 Test
```bash
pytest -q tests/test_crawler.py
```
- ✅ Validates score ranking (lab > news)
- ✅ Confirms link expansion, ordering, and page fetching

## 🔄 Output Format
```python
[ { "url": ..., "html": ... }, ... ], visited_urls: set[str]
```

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Simple and extensible for LLM-guided link scoring
- ✅ Uses safe URL resolution and domain filter
- 🟡 Future: integrate metadata (e.g., depth, anchor text) into output for extractors
