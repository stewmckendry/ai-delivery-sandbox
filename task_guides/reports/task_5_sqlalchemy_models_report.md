# Task 5 Review: SQLAlchemy Models for Health Data

## ✅ Summary
Agent created:
- SQLAlchemy `LabResult` and `VisitSummary` models
- `init_db()` method in `db.py` to create schema
- Unit test validating DB creation and sample inserts using in-memory SQLite

## 📂 Files Created
- `app/__init__.py`
- `app/storage/__init__.py`
- `app/storage/db.py`
- `app/storage/models.py`
- `tests/test_models.py`

## ▶️ How to Test
```bash
pytest tests/test_models.py
```
🔧 Ensure `sqlalchemy` is installed locally first

## ✅ Unit Test
- Sets `DATABASE_URL` to `sqlite:///:memory:`
- Creates schema via `init_db()`
- Inserts and verifies one `LabResult` and one `VisitSummary`

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Well-structured, easy to integrate
- ✅ Smart use of env override for in-memory DB
- 🟡 Good candidate to refactor test DB setup into fixture for future reuse

## 🔁 Next Step
Merge into main branch and build endpoints to access this data.
