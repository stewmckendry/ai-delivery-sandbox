# Task 1 Review: Playwright Login Automation

## ✅ Summary
Agent delivered a working Playwright script that:
- Loads credentials from `.env`
- Navigates to `https://mock-health-portal.dev/login`
- Logs in using assumed selectors
- Saves the post-login HTML to `login_page.html`

## 📂 File Created
- `app/adapters/mock_portal.py`

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python app/adapters/mock_portal.py
```
Requires `.env` with:
```
MOCK_USERNAME=exampleuser
MOCK_PASSWORD=examplepass
```

## ✅ Testing
- Script runs successfully
- Outputs HTML snapshot

## ⚠️ Assumptions
- Assumes the login form uses:
  - `input[name='username']`
  - `input[name='password']`
  - `button[type='submit']`
- These may need adjustment per portal

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Efficient and functional
- 🟡 For future portals, selector flexibility could be added
- ✅ Good starting point for full adapter integration

## 🔁 Next Step
No changes required. Ready to use this as a base for next scraper adapters.

Great example of fast, agent-driven coding with solid handoff context.
