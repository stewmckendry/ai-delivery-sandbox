# Task 33 Review: test_portal_b Complex Mock Adapter

## âœ… Summary
Implements a richer test portal with:
- Multi-page navigation
- Modal-based visit summary
- Table-based lab results
- Downloadable billing file
- PDF lab file for mixed content testing

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `app/adapters/test_portal_b.py`
- `tests/test_test_portal_b_adapter.py`

## ðŸ§ª Behavior
- Writes HTML, TXT, and PDF files to `/tmp`
- Uses Playwright to simulate navigation + interactions
- Returns file paths to ETL for parsing + summarization

## âœ… Tests
```bash
pytest -q tests/test_test_portal_b_adapter.py
```
- âœ… Verifies all file types are returned and exist
- âœ… Covers modal, table, and link-based content

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback
- âœ… Great coverage of common UI patterns
- âœ… Easily extendable to simulate more real-world portal quirks
- ðŸŸ¡ OpenAI API key still required for full run

## ðŸš€ This adapter enables robust testing of the ETL pipeline against complex, mixed-format health portal content.
