# Task 4 Review: Scaffold FastAPI App

## ✅ Summary
Agent created a foundational FastAPI app that:
- Exposes a root endpoint `/` returning `{ "status": "ok" }`
- Sets up for modular routing from `app/api/`
- Includes `run_local.sh` script for dev server
- Provides a unit test validating endpoint behavior

## 📂 Files Created
- `app/main.py`
- `run_local.sh`
- `app/api/__init__.py`
- `tests/test_main.py`

## ▶️ Manual Test
Run locally (after installing deps):
```bash
chmod +x run_local.sh
./run_local.sh
```
Visit: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
Should return: `{ "status": "ok" }`

## 🧪 Unit Test
```bash
pytest tests/test_main.py
```
❌ Skipped in Codex due to env limitations (`httpx` not available)
✅ Expected to pass locally once dependencies are installed

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Structure is solid and extensible
- ✅ Good use of docstrings and fallback for optional routers
- 🟡 Consider capturing router import errors more explicitly in prod

## 🔁 Next Step
Merge and integrate. This base supports upcoming routers and endpoints.
