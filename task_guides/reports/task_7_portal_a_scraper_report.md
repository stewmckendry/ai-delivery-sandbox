# Task 7 Review: Portal A Scraper

## ✅ Summary
Agent created a Playwright-based scraper that:
- Logs into a mock health portal
- Fills `username` and `password` fields
- Saves dashboard HTML to `/tmp/portal_a_dashboard.html`
- Downloads up to 3 PDFs and saves to `/tmp/`
- Returns list of saved file paths and metadata summary

## 📂 File Created
- `app/adapters/portal_a.py`

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python app/adapters/portal_a.py <username> <password>
```
Expected output: list of saved file paths + `{ "pdf_count": X }`

## ✅ Compilation
```bash
python -m py_compile app/adapters/portal_a.py
```

## ❌ Testing in Agent
- Could not run pytest or install `playwright` due to env limitations
- Function appears well-structured and idiomatic

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Modular and self-contained with CLI runner
- ✅ Good use of `async_playwright` context
- 🟡 Next step: plug into file store for structured handoff

## 🔁 Next Step
Test locally with mocked credentials or test portal. Ready for adapter integration.
