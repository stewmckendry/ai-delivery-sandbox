# Task 6 Review: Redis Session Store Utility

## ✅ Summary
Agent implemented:
- `set_key`, `get_key`, `delete_key`, `is_connected` helpers
- Redis config via `.env` with fallback defaults
- Demo usage in `__main__`
- Fully mocked unit test using a `FakeRedis` class

## 📂 Files Created
- `app/storage/redis.py`
- `tests/test_redis_storage.py`

## ✅ Unit Test Strategy
- Uses `monkeypatch` to mock `redis` and `dotenv`
- Injects `FakeRedis` for logic validation
- Passes set → get → delete → verify delete

## ▶️ How to Run Locally
Ensure `redis` and `python-dotenv` are installed, then:
```bash
pytest tests/test_redis_storage.py
```

## 💬 Feedback
- ✅ Clean, self-contained, and testable
- ✅ Excellent use of monkeypatch for dependency-free testing
- 🟡 Can extend in future for pub/sub or key namespacing

## 🔁 Next Step
Component is ready for integration as credential/session cache.
