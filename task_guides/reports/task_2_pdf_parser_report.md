# Task 2 Review: PDF Parsing with PyMuPDF

## ‚úÖ Summary
Agent delivered a functional `extract_lab_results` function that:
- Uses `fitz` from PyMuPDF to open and read a PDF
- Attempts to extract lab result lines
- Returns structured data as a list of dicts

## üìÇ Files Created
- `app/processors/__init__.py`
- `app/processors/pdf_parser.py`

## ‚ùå Testing Status
- Code could not be run due to missing `fitz` (PyMuPDF) module in agent environment
- Function appears well-structured and ready for local test with `sample_lab.pdf`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è To Test Locally
Ensure you have PyMuPDF installed:
```bash
pip install pymupdf
```
Run this:
```python
from app.processors.pdf_parser import extract_lab_results
print(extract_lab_results('sample_lab.pdf'))
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Feedback
- Good foundational parsing logic
- May need layout-specific tuning depending on the structure of PDFs from real portals
- Testing locally is the next priority

## üîÅ Next Step
- Validate locally using a mock or real PDF sample
- Adjust text extraction logic if formatting is inconsistent

---
Good progress despite environment limitations ‚Äî function structure is solid.
