# Task 22 Review: Human-in-the-Loop MFA + Challenge Flow

## âœ… Summary
Implemented a Playwright + Redis challenge handling system that:
- Detects login interruptions (OTP, CAPTCHA, security questions)
- Saves a screenshot + description to Redis
- Waits for user input, then resumes the session with that response
- Fully integrated into orchestrator flow

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `app/adapters/common/challenges.py`
- `app/orchestrator.py` (updated)
- `tests/test_challenges.py`
- `tests/test_orchestrator.py` (expanded)

## ðŸ§ª Behavior
- Challenges are returned with a `challenge_id` and `resume()` callback
- Orchestrator waits using `await_response`, then passes result to resume
- All actions are logged using audit logger

## ðŸ”„ Detected Elements
- OTP (input[name='otp'])
- CAPTCHA (image with alt="captcha")
- Security question (input[name='security_answer'])

## âœ… Test Coverage
```bash
pytest -q tests/test_challenges.py
pytest -q tests/test_orchestrator.py
```
- âœ… Simulates user input via Redis
- âœ… Verifies that resumed sessions parse and insert content as expected

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback
- âœ… Modular and easy to extend
- âœ… No assumptions about portal structure â€” content-agnostic
- âœ… Logs each challenge pause/resume securely

## ðŸš€ Production-grade flow now possible for challenge-interrupted logins
