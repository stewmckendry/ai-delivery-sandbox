# ✅ Task 204 CR Report: Migrate Consent Flow to Copilot

## 📄 Summary
Completed the CR to move the consent experience from an HTML page into a Copilot-aligned chat experience. Users are now prompted via `/status` and confirm via `/process` POST.

## 🔧 Implementation
- `/status` now returns JSON with a prompt message based on pending files
- `/process` POST remains as the backend for logging consent and running ETL
- Logic separated cleanly for frontend (Copilot) and backend handling

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed
- ✅ `tests/test_process_api.py`
  - Confirms `/status` returns proper prompt text
  - Validates consent logging and ETL trigger

## ✅ Files Changed
- `app/api/etl.py`
- `tests/test_process_api.py`

## 🏁 Outcome
Consent UX is now fully Copilot-compatible. ChatGPT can call `/status` to check readiness and `/process` to confirm and run analysis.
