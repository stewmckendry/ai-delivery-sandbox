# ✅ Task 204 Report: Consent and Confirm Before ETL

## 📄 Summary
Introduced an ETL confirmation step with explicit user consent and audit logging before processing uploaded files.

## 🔧 Implementation
- Added FastAPI route `/process`:
  - `GET` returns an HTML confirmation form with file count
  - `POST` logs consent and calls `run_etl_from_blobs()`
- `audit.log_event()` used to record `consent_given` action with timestamp
- Set `DRY_RUN` to skip ETL during testing

## ⚠️ UX Note
Currently uses a basic HTML prompt, not integrated into ChatGPT Copilot flow. To unify UX, recommend migrating this logic to Copilot interface (e.g., via /status route or chat tool).

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest tests/test_process_api.py -q`
  - Confirms confirmation message
  - Validates audit log
  - Asserts ETL is triggered after consent
- ✅ `pytest -q` passes

## ✅ Files Changed
- `app/api/__init__.py` (+ router)
- `app/api/etl.py` (new confirmation + consent route)
- `tests/test_process_api.py` (unit coverage)

## 🏁 Outcome
Confirms ethical handling of uploads before processing. Lays foundation for deeper integration with Copilot UX.
