# ✅ Task 203 Report: ETL from Azure Blob Uploads

## 📄 Summary
Introduced support for ingesting files uploaded to Azure Blob via the Copilot-Operator flow. Enabled CLI and orchestrator support for processing structured and unstructured medical records from a given blob prefix.

## 🔧 Implementation
- Added `run_etl_from_blobs(prefix)` to `app/orchestrator.py`
- Each file is saved, type-detected (by extension), and routed to the appropriate parser:
  - `.pdf` → `extract_lab_results_with_date`
  - `.html/.htm` → `extract_visit_summaries`
  - `.txt` → raw text passed to structuring
- Unified extractor → cleaner → structurer used for all HTML/text files
- CLI tool: `scripts/run_etl_from_blob.py`

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed
- ✅ `pytest tests/test_blob_etl.py -q` confirms:
  - Visits parsed
  - Labs parsed
  - Structured records created
  - Summary written to `logs/blob_runs/`

## 📌 Notes
- Requires `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` to be set
- Automatically deletes blobs post-ingestion
- Suggest follow-up task to **generalize type detection** (based on content not extension)

## ✅ Files Changed
- `app/orchestrator.py`
- `scripts/run_etl_from_blob.py`
- `tests/test_blob_etl.py`

## 🏁 Outcome
Blob upload ingestion pipeline is fully functional and integrated with summarizer. Can be triggered via CLI or later via API.
