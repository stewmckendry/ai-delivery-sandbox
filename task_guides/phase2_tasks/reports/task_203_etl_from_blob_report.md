# ✅ Task 203 Report: ETL from Azure Blob Uploads

## 📄 Summary
Introduced support for ingesting files uploaded to Azure Blob via the Copilot-Operator flow. Enabled CLI and orchestrator support for processing structured and unstructured medical records from a given blob prefix.

## 🔧 Implementation
- Added `run_etl_from_blobs(prefix)` to `app/orchestrator.py`
- Each blob is downloaded, saved, and routed based on suffix:
  - `.pdf` → parsed as labs
  - `.html/.htm` → parsed as visit summaries
  - `.txt` → treated as raw text for structuring
- All `.html` and `.txt` go through:
  - `extractor.extract_relevant_content`
  - `cleaner.clean_blocks`
  - `insert_structured_records`
- CLI wrapper: `scripts/run_etl_from_blob.py`
- Summary is logged to `logs/blob_runs/<session>_summary.md`

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed
- ✅ `pytest tests/test_blob_etl.py -q`
  - Covers visit, lab, and structured record paths
  - Validates summary generation and blob deletion

## 📌 Notes
- Blob type detection still uses file extension
- HTML/TXT are routed through general extractor pipeline
- Blobs are deleted after processing to conserve space

## ✅ Files Changed
- `app/orchestrator.py`
- `scripts/run_etl_from_blob.py`
- `tests/test_blob_etl.py`

## 🏁 Outcome
Flexible and extensible ETL pipeline for user-uploaded files is now operational. Next improvement: detect record type via content or metadata instead of relying on filename alone.
