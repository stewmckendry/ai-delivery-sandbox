# ✅ Task 205 Report: Status Route

## 📄 Summary
Implemented the `/status` API route to give users insight into what data has been uploaded, when, and what structured records exist in the database.

## 🔧 Implementation
- Added `/status?session_key=xyz` endpoint
- Aggregates:
  - Uploaded file metadata (via audit log)
  - Counts of labs, visits, structured records
  - Most recent upload and processing timestamps
- Returns JSON with counts + latest timestamps

## 📂 Supporting Changes
- `UploadRecord` model added for extensible metadata tracking
- `get_session()` helper ensures DB tables exist before use

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed
- ✅ `tests/test_status_api.py` confirms:
  - Uploads are parsed from audit log
  - Record counts are accurate
  - Latest timestamps are correct

## ✅ Files Changed
- `app/api/status.py` (new route)
- `app/storage/db.py` (+ `get_session()`)
- `app/storage/models.py` (+ `UploadRecord` model)
- `tests/test_status_api.py`
- `app/api/__init__.py`

## 🏁 Outcome
Users can now audit their uploads and view structured record summaries via the `/status` route. Future improvement: expose this inside Copilot via a `/status` tool.
