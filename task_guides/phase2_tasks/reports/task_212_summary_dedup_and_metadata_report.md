# ✅ Task 212 Report: Summary Deduplication + Metadata Enrichment

## 📄 Summary
Improves `/summary` to be fully session-aware, filters per-user record sets, and adds deduplication to avoid repeated ingestion of the same file. Also logs richer metadata to support traceability and user transparency.

---

## 🔧 Implementation
- **Structured Records:**
  - Deduped by `(session_key, source_url, text)` using in-memory set
  - Added `is_duplicate` flag in `structured_records`
- **Labs + Visits:**
  - Added `session_key` to models
  - All queries and summaries now filter by session
- **Summary API:**
  - Returns per-user record list and stats
  - Only most recent record date per type is shown
- **Documentation:**
  - `/summary` behavior + dedup logic added to `operator_guidance.md`

---

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed
- Confirmed re-uploaded files do not double-insert records
- `/summary` reflects only current session's records

---

## ✅ Files Changed
- `status.py`, `models.py`, `structured.py`, `structuring.py`, `orchestrator.py`
- `operator_guidance.md`
- `tests/test_status_api.py`, `test_structuring.py`, `test_orchestrator.py`

---

## 🏁 Outcome
Operator-derived uploads now produce clean, scoped, and deduplicated summaries. RAG tools will only see records from the current session with clear source trails and no repeats.
