# ✅ Task 211 Report: Structured Record Session Filter + ETL Log Cleanup

## 📄 Summary
Implements support for multi-user data scoping by introducing `session_key` across structured records and tools. Also simplifies ETL logs by suppressing noisy traces and surfacing clearer progress logs.

---

## 🔧 Implementation
- **Structured Records:**
  - Added `session_key` column (indexed)
  - All insertions now scoped to session
- **ETL Logs:**
  - Suppressed verbose logs from `httpx`, `azure`, and `openai`
  - Added ETL progress messages: record counts, session scope
- **APIs:**
  - `/summary` and `/ask` return session-specific results
- **CLI Tools:**
  - `--session-key` now supported in `ask_tool.py` and `export_records.py`
- **SQL Migration:**
  - New script: `docs/structured_records_session_key.sql` to drop and recreate table

---

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed
- Confirmed filtered `/ask` and `/summary` output
- Verified no record leakage across sessions

---

## ✅ Files Changed
- 16 total including:
  - `models.py`, `structured.py`, `orchestrator.py`
  - `ask_tool.py`, `export_records.py`
  - `test_*`, `rag.py`, `status.py`

---

## 🏁 Outcome
App now supports secure, scoped, multi-session operation. Logs are cleaner, debugging is simpler, and tooling is fully session-aware.
