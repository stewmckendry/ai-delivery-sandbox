# ✅ Task 201 Report: Upload UI to Azure Blob

## 📄 Summary
This task implemented a user-friendly, secure upload interface that lets users send files (downloaded via OpenAI Operator) to Azure Blob Storage for ETL processing.

## 🔧 Implementation
- **New FastAPI route** `/upload` serves a file upload form (`upload_form.html`)
- **SAS URL endpoint** `/upload/sas` returns short-lived upload URLs for secure PUTs
- **Audit endpoint** `/upload/log` stores metadata via `record_upload()`
- **Azure integration** via `app/storage/blob.py`, using `azure-storage-blob`
- **HTML frontend** allows drag-and-drop or multi-file selection

## ✅ Files Changed
- `app/api/upload.py` – new router with form, SAS, log endpoints
- `app/storage/blob.py` – SAS generator, upload logger
- `app/web/upload_form.html` – frontend upload page
- `app/api/__init__.py` – router registration
- `requirements.txt` – added `azure-storage-blob`

## 🔐 Notes
- Requires `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` env var
- Files validated by extension: PDF, HTML, TXT
- Uploads scoped to session_key folder, expire after 15 min

## 🧪 Test Coverage
- ✅ Manual: HTML form drag-drop, uploads
- ✅ Verified: SAS URLs working, Blob uploads present
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed

## 🏁 Outcome
This upload interface completes the handoff between Operator-based file gathering and Copilot-driven ETL ingestion.
