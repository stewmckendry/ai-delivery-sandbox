# Codex Agent Task: Scaffold FastAPI App (Railway-ready)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Create the base FastAPI app structure and health check endpoint.

## ðŸ“‚ Target Files
- `app/main.py`
- `run_local.sh`
- (Empty) `app/api/__init__.py`

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions
- Use FastAPI to create an app instance
- Define a root route (`/`) that returns `{ "status": "ok" }`
- Prepare to mount future routers from `app/api/`
- Add a `run_local.sh` that runs Uvicorn with hot reload
- Make sure itâ€™s compatible with Railway (env PORT or default 8000)

## âœ… What to Report Back
- File paths and full content
- CLI commands to run locally
- Test output: request to `/` returns expected JSON
- Unit test included (if practical) + test result
- Any config needed for Railway deployment
