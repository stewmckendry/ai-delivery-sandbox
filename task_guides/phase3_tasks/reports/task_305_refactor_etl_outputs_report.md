# ✅ Task 305 Report: Refactor ETL Outputs for Privacy-Safe Cloud Deployment

## 🎯 Goal
Remove all local writes of summaries or structured health data, and migrate non-sensitive logs (e.g., uploads) to secure ephemeral cloud storage (Azure Blob).

---

## 🔧 Changes Implemented
### Summary Outputs
- ✅ ETL summaries are **no longer written to `logs/`**
- ✅ Summaries are returned inline from:
  - `run_etl_for_portal`
  - `run_etl_from_blobs`
- ✅ `/process` now returns the summary in the API response

### Audit Logs
- ✅ Upload metadata saved to:
  - `audit/<session>.json` in Azure Blob
  - Local fallback log only used if cloud write fails
- ✅ Fields include session_key, portal, filename, timestamp

---

## 📁 Updated Files
- `app/api/etl.py`, `app/orchestrator.py`: removed file writes, return summary
- `app/storage/blob.py`: added `upload_text` and blob-based audit logging
- Test scripts and API tests updated to assert correct return behavior

---

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed all tests
- ✅ Verified no writes to `logs/`
- ✅ Confirmed JSON audit files appear in Azure Blob
- ✅ `/process` returns correct summary

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Some outbound requests (e.g., fetching dependencies) were blocked
- Consider whitelisting required domains (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`) in the Railway project if needed

---

## ✅ Outcome
- All ETL outputs are compliant with privacy principles
- Summaries are ephemeral and never stored
- Upload logs are minimal, scoped, and secure
- Cloud deployment is now privacy-safe by design
