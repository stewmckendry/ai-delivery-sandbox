# ✅ Task 309 Report: Clinical Type Classification with LLM

## 🎯 Goal
Enhance the ETL process to classify extracted structured records into clinical types (e.g., Medication, Condition, Allergy) using a more intelligent method than regex.

---

## 🤖 New Approach
- ✅ Introduced `_classify_clinical_type()` logic using an LLM (via `chat_completion()`)
- ✅ Extracts: `clinical_type`, `code`, `code_system`, `display`
- ✅ Falls back on existing regex if LLM does not classify confidently

---

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Mocked `chat_completion` in test to simulate LLM behavior
- ✅ Confirmed ETL can detect:
  - Medications (e.g., Metformin → RxNorm)
  - Conditions (e.g., Diabetes → SNOMED)
  - Allergies
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed full suite

---

## 🧠 Benefits
- More accurate clinical typing across diverse documents
- Adds coded metadata for structured export and querying
- Maintains backward compatibility with `structured_records`

---

## 📁 Updated Files
- `app/orchestrator.py`: LLM classifier + fallback
- `app/prompts/summarizer.py`: prompt update
- `app/api/status.py`, `app/api/rag.py`: improved type formatting
- `app/storage/models.py`: additional classification fields
- `scripts/ask_tool.py`: updated print for clinical type

---

## ✅ Outcome
Structured records are now typed and coded with LLM-enriched metadata, improving downstream use in summaries, queries, and future clinical integration.
