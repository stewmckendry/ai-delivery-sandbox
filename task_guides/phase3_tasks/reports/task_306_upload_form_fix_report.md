# ✅ Task 306 Report: Upload Form Fixes

## 🎯 Goal
Fix the `/upload` web interface to correctly send Azure uploads and provide file selection feedback.

---

## 🔧 Summary of Fixes
- ✅ Added `x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob` header for Azure Blob uploads (required for SAS `PUT` requests)
- ✅ Implemented live file list UI
  - Shows file names when selected or dropped
  - Displays status: "Uploading...", "Uploaded ✔", or error messages

---

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Manual test: selected and dropped files both trigger upload and are listed with status
- ✅ Uploads succeed via browser using SAS URL
- ✅ Regression tested on `/upload` via deployed Railway URL
- ✅ `pytest -q` passed

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Some browser-based requests may still be blocked in Railway depending on client or CORS
- Future enhancement: show per-file progress bar or support multi-file retries

---

## 📁 Updated Files
- `app/web/upload_form.html`

---

## ✅ Outcome
Upload flow is now intuitive, transparent, and reliable for cloud-based users, enabling drag-and-drop and status feedback during file transfer.
