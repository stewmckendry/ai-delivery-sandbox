# ‚úÖ Task 307 Report: Clinical Standards Review Complete

## üéØ Goal
Review and enhance the structured record model and ETL flow to align with standard clinical vocabularies and FHIR resource mappings.

---

## üß† Summary of Recommendations

### 1. **Extend Data Models with FHIR Codes**
- ‚úÖ Fields for `clinical_type`, `code`, `code_system`, and `display` now added to `structured_records`
- ‚úÖ Structure supports alignment with FHIR `Observation`, `Condition`, `Procedure`, etc.
- ‚úÖ SNOMED, LOINC, and RxNorm mappings enabled where relevant

**Suggested follow-up task:**
‚û°Ô∏è Add dedicated `fhir_resources` table to store full resource objects

---

### 2. **Update Blob ETL to Generate FHIR-Compliant Records**
- ‚úÖ Blob-based ETL pipeline now supports record typing
- ‚úÖ Classifications are enriched using LLM (see Task 309)

**Suggested follow-up task:**
‚û°Ô∏è Transform structured records into FHIR Bundles during ETL

---

### 3. **Provide FHIR Export Format**
- ‚öôÔ∏è Currently supports Markdown, PDF, JSON

**Suggested follow-up task:**
‚û°Ô∏è Add FHIR Bundle export via `/export?format=fhir` or CLI tool

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome
System is now FHIR-aware and stores type + terminology data that can map to canonical resources. Enables next steps for data exchange, provider sharing, and API compatibility with clinical systems.
