# âœ… Task 302 Report: Custom GPT Setup Completed

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Set up the MyHealth Copilot Custom GPT with API integration to the deployed FastAPI backend.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Artifacts Created
- `app/api/export.py`: New route to support `/export` via HTTP (replacing CLI-only script)
- `app/main.py`: Registered `export` router with FastAPI app
- `docs/custom_gpt_setup.md`: Final GPT configuration instructions (title, system prompt, API setup)
- `docs/openapi.json`: Cleaned and validated schema to enable GPT tool calling

---

## ðŸ›  Challenges & Fixes
| Challenge | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| `openapi.json` schema failed validation | Used schema from prior GPT-integrated app as working reference |
| Custom GPT tool context was too generic | Codex agent pulled from actual context fields (labs, visits, structured notes) to improve system prompt and sample queries |

---

## âœ… Verified
- GPT can call `/ask`, `/summary`, and `/export` from the deployed API
- System prompt now guides GPT to:
  - Ask for upload
  - Trigger `/process`
  - Answer based on structured data

---

## ðŸ”š Outcome
The GPT setup is now complete, integrated with Railway APIs, and ready for user-facing tests via MyHealth Copilot.

Next: Run Task 303 against GPT to confirm correct tool usage and response accuracy.
