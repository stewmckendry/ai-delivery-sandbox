# ✅ Task 308 Report: Privacy & Security Review Completed

## 🎯 Goal
Improve the security posture of the AI Health Copilot stack, covering GPT, Operator, FastAPI, and Azure Storage layers.

---

## 🔒 Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Secure Session Management**
- ✅ Created a new `/session` route to return random UUIDs for session_key
- ✅ Added `app/utils/session.py` for cryptographically generated keys
- ✅ Updated Custom GPT system instructions to start every flow by calling `/session`
- ✅ Updated operator guidance and testing guides to use the new `/session` route

### 2. **Temporary File Cleanup**
- ✅ Deleted challenge screenshots after use in the Operator login flow
- ✅ Added `RAW_CLEANUP` flag to remove raw files after ETL is complete
- ✅ Implemented `delete_file()` helper in blob layer
- ✅ Updated documentation to describe these retention policies

### 3. **Authentication Foundation**
- Proposed middleware for bearer token auth (task queued separately)
- API routes reviewed for session key isolation

---

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ All updates verified via `pytest -q`
- ✅ Session keys returned successfully
- ✅ Upload/ETL flow confirmed clean post-run

---

## 📁 Files Updated
- `app/api/session.py`, `app/main.py`
- `app/utils/session.py`, `app/utils/__init__.py`
- `app/adapters/common/challenges.py`
- `app/storage/blob.py` (delete support)
- `docs/custom_gpt_setup.md`, `project/docs/operator_guidance.md`

---

## ✅ Outcome
Session scoping is now secure by default, temporary files are cleaned, and groundwork for full authentication is in place. The system is safer for personal health data across both cloud and user-controlled paths.
