# ðŸ’¬ Task 317: Create Prompt Starter Kit for MyHealth Assistant

## ðŸ§  Context
This task is part of launch prep for sharing the AI Health Records Assistant more widely. The assistant is live at `ai-delivery-sandbox` on the `sandbox-curious-fox` branch.

Users will need guidance on what types of questions they can ask the custom GPT after uploading health records.

## ðŸŒŸ Goal
Design a clear, useful "Prompt Starter Kit" organized by use case so that users can:
- Understand what types of health questions are supported
- Explore their records meaningfully
- Get ideas on how to use the assistant safely and productively

## ðŸ“¦ What to Include
- Example prompts by category:
  - âœ… Labs and test results
  - âœ… Past visits and hospital encounters
  - âœ… Diagnoses and conditions
  - âœ… Activity and vitals
  - âœ… Summary prep ("Can you summarize my records?")
  - âœ… Sharing support ("Prepare a PDF I can give to my doctor")
- Optional grouping: general questions, first-time users, caregivers
- Keep prompts short and plain-language for accessibility

## ðŸ§ª Done When
- Starter kit is saved to `project/docs/prompt_starter_kit.md`
- Can be copy-pasted into the GPT instructions or shared as a download

Let Stewart know once complete so he can include it in GPT setup and blog linkouts.
