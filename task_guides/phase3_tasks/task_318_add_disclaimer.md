# ⚠️ Task 318: Add Limitation Disclaimer for MyHealth Assistant

## 🧠 Context
This task is part of preparing the AI Health Records Assistant for broader public use. The repo is `ai-delivery-sandbox`, branch `sandbox-curious-fox`.

A clear disclaimer is needed to:
- Manage expectations about what the AI can and cannot do
- Clarify that this is not a medical device or decision-support tool
- Reinforce that outputs are for informational use only

## 📄 Goal
Create a plain-language disclaimer that can be displayed:
- Inside GPT instructions (or at session start)
- On web-facing materials (blog, README, PDF summary)

## 📦 Deliverable
- Save text to `project/docs/disclaimer.md`
- Should include:
  - Purpose of the tool
  - What it does not do (e.g., diagnose, replace clinicians)
  - A reminder that results should be reviewed with a healthcare provider

## 🧪 Done When
- A clear, friendly, professional disclaimer is saved in the repo
- Ready for inclusion in GPT flows and external documentation

Let Stewart know when it’s ready for copy into ChatGPT setup and blog materials.
