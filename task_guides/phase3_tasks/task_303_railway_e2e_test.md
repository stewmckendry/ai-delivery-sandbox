## üß™ Test Steps
Adapted from `task_209_end_to_end_test_plan.md`

### 1. Start Session
```bash
curl https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/session
```
Use the returned `session_key` for the following steps.

### 2. File Collection
 - ‚úÖ Save `.html` or `.pdf` file exported from a health portal
 - ‚úÖ Inspect locally to confirm content integrity

### 3. Upload via Web Interface
Open:
```
https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/upload?session=<key>&portal=strava
```
 - ‚úÖ Drag and drop or select file to upload
 - ‚úÖ Confirm success message "Uploaded <filename>"
 - ‚úÖ Metadata is logged automatically

### 4. Trigger ETL via Railway
```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/process -F session_key=<key>
```
- ‚úÖ Logs show extraction and DB insertion

### 5. Ask Question
```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are my latest test results?", "session_key": "<key>"}'
```
- ‚úÖ Response includes extracted record content

### 6. Export Data via API
Markdown:
```bash
curl "https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/export?session_key=<key>&format=markdown"
```
JSON:
```bash
curl "https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/export?session_key=<key>&format=json"
```
PDF:
```bash
curl -o records.pdf "https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/export?session_key=<key>&format=pdf"
```
- ‚úÖ Outputs match uploaded file and extracted data

### 7. Check Status
```bash
curl https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/summary?session_key=<key> | jq
```
- ‚úÖ Confirm structured counts, timestamps, and sources

## ‚úÖ Done When
- `/upload`, `/process`, `/ask`, `/export`, and `/summary` all work via Railway
- Responses reflect uploaded file content
- Agent provides sample output and issues if any
