# ðŸ“¦ Task 321: Assemble Onboarding Package for New Users

## ðŸ§  Context
This task builds on Tasks 317â€“320, which generate:
- Prompt Starter Kit
- Disclaimer / Limitations
- Demo data and session loading route
- Access and usage guidance

All of this content needs to be structured into a clear onboarding kit that makes it easy to:
- Test the assistant with mock data
- Understand usage constraints and responsibilities
- Explore what the assistant can do

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Create a unified onboarding folder and content package for new users, including both GPT users and technical collaborators.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
Create a new folder: `project/onboarding/` with:

- `README.md` â€” quickstart guide with links to:
  - `/load_demo` usage instructions
  - Starter prompts for GPT
  - Disclaimers and safe usage rules
  - Operator/Pro guidance

- Links to relevant docs:
  - `project/docs/prompt_starter_kit.md`
  - `project/docs/disclaimer.md`
  - `project/docs/user_access_guidance.md`

- Include a short usage script or session snippet that GPT can preload
- Bonus: add PDF export of the onboarding content (optional)

## ðŸ§ª Done When
- One-click onboarding flow is testable
- Can be sent with the blog, GPT link, or repo invite
- GPTs and users have all the tools and instructions to test and explore safely

Let Stewart know when it's live so he can link it from the blog and GPT instructions.
