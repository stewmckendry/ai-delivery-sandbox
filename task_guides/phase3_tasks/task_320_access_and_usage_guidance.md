# 🙋‍♀️ Task 320: Write Access & Usage Guidance for New Users

## 🧠 Context
The AI Health Records Assistant is being prepared for public or semi-public use. The repo is `ai-delivery-sandbox`, branch `sandbox-curious-fox`.

Many users may:
- Not have ChatGPT Pro (which is required to use Operator)
- Be unsure whether they should use Operator with real portals
- Want to test the assistant without uploading personal data

## 🎯 Goal
Create clear guidance for these users so they:
- Know what they can do without Operator or Pro
- Understand usage boundaries and disclaimers
- Can test the app safely and meaningfully

## 📦 What to Include
- Who can use the assistant right now (Pro users vs. non-Pro)
- When Operator is recommended and when it’s not (e.g., live portals vs. mock demo)
- What works even without Pro:
  - Upload mock files
  - Ask questions about sample sessions
  - View summaries and exports
- Best practices if using real portals (your own data, understand terms of use)

## 📄 Output
- Save to: `project/docs/user_access_guidance.md`
- Should be plain-language, easy to copy into GPT instructions or onboarding email

## 🧪 Done When
- Guidance is live and sharable
- Linked from README and blog if needed

Let Stewart know when this is complete so it can be distributed with test links or demo flows.
