### 🧪 Test Package: [test_package_01_explorer_gpt_simulation.md](https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/tree/sandbox-silent-otter/test/e2e/test_package_01_explorer_gpt_simulation.md)

### 💬 Summary
This test simulated a full Explorer journey through GPT, completing the "Design Your Dream Job" prompt with rich answers. The journaling was successfully saved, and the user saw a confirmation from GPT.

### 🔍 Result Details
- **Prompt Used**: `dream_job`
- **User Answers**: 
  - Dream job: Golden Doodle Whisperer
  - Location: On the moon
  - Daily activity: Space walk
  - Tools: Astronaut + Astrodog suits
  - Reflection: Walking with Charlie in the stars
- **Career Suggested**: Not explicitly shown; assumed to be embedded in narrative
- **Reflection Saved**: ✅ Confirmed in Notion + Airtable
- **Field Missing**: `career_id` was not passed on `record_reflection`, causing the Airtable career field to be blank

### ✅ Passed
- Prompt interaction and Q&A flow
- GPT narrative synthesis and journaling tone
- Data saved to both Notion and Airtable

### ⚠️ Improvement Needed
- Ensure `career_id` is explicitly passed in the `record_reflection` tool call — GPT did not include it in this test.

---

### 📌 Recommendation
Train GPT or improve tool hinting to include a `career_id` from the YAML segment (or inferred category) during the save step.

### 🧠 Observations
- GPT generated a beautiful, imaginative story without needing structured inputs.
- Confirmation messages made the experience feel complete and magical for the user.
