# ✅ Scenario 1 E2E Test Summary

**User Journey:** Start triage → log incident → assess concussion → get stage guidance

---

### 🧪 Test Results

1. **Triage Started**
- Tool: `get_triage_flow`
- ✅ Loaded structured triage questions

2. **Triage Questions Walkthrough**
- Responses:
  - Reporter: "my daughter"
  - Sport: "soccer"
  - Age: "U11"
  - Team: "informal - playing with friends"
  - Injury date: "2025-05-01"
  - Context: "She bumped the ball with her head"
  - Symptoms: {"headache": 1, "dizziness": 1}
  - No LOC, no provider, no diagnosed concussion → inferred
  - Still symptomatic, not cleared

3. **Incident Logging**
- First attempt failed due to invalid dict passed for `symptoms` param → SQL error
- ✅ Retry without symptoms: success
- ✅ Retry with `user_002` and symptoms: success

4. **Concussion Assessment**
- Tool: `assess_concussion`
- ✅ Result: Concussion unlikely, moderate symptoms (headache, dizziness), no red flags

5. **Stage Guidance Error**
- Tool: `get_stage_guidance`
- ❌ Error: `symptom_severity_max` was invalid due to `none` in YAML → logic mismatch

---

### ✅ Outcome
- Confirmed triage, logging, and assessment tools work as expected
- Identified backend + YAML design issues with stage guidance → triggered full redesign
- Flow stopped at stage guidance due to invalid data model

---

### 🧠 Lessons
- Schema clarity in OpenAPI + YAML is essential to avoid logic gaps
- Tool fallback behavior (e.g., inferring data, validating types) should be baked in early
