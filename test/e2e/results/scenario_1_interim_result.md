## 🧪 Scenario 1: Interim Test Results (Baseline Flow)

### ✅ Completed
- **getTriageFlow**: Successfully loaded structured triage question list
- **Triage Walkthrough**: All responses collected, including inferred values for diagnosed_concussion and cleared_to_play

### 📝 Incident Logging
- **logIncidentDetail (Initial Attempt)**:
  - ❌ Failed due to symptom payload type
  - Error: `(pyodbc.ProgrammingError) ('Invalid parameter type.  param-index=7 param-type=dict', 'HY105')`
  - Cause: `symptoms` field (dict) could not be directly inserted into SQL `incident_report_export`
- **logIncidentDetail (Retry Without Symptoms)**:
  - ✅ Succeeded
  - Data confirmed in DB under `incident_report_export`
  - ⚠️ No entry found in `symptom_log_export`

### ❌ assessConcussion
- Request: `{ "user_id": "user_001" }`
- Error: `"No symptom log found. Complete triage first."`
- Blocker: No symptoms persisted due to earlier insert error → downstream tools fail

### 🔍 Diagnosis
- `symptoms` as a dictionary is incompatible with SQL ORM insert without conversion
- Likely field type mismatch in `IncidentReport` model or untransformed input in tool logic

### 🔧 Next Step
Investigate and patch serialization logic for `symptoms` in:
- `IncidentReport` model (check column type)
- `log_incident_detail.py` (ensure dict → JSON string or appropriate type)

→ Patch coming next.
