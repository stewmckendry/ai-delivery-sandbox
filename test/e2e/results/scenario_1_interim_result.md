## 🧪 Scenario 1: Interim Test Results (Updated)

### ✅ Completed Steps
1. **GET /getTriageFlow** – Triage map loaded
2. **Walked through triage questions**:
   - All responses captured including inferred answers (e.g., `diagnosed_concussion`)
3. **POST /logIncidentDetail**
   - ❌ Initial error with `symptoms` dict → SQL insert failed
   - ✅ Fix deployed → retry with user_id `user_002` succeeded with full data
4. **POST /assessConcussion** (user_002)
   - ✅ Success: no red flags, low symptom scores, `concussion_likely = false`
5. **GET /getLinkedSymptoms** confirmed symptom data was logged

### ❌ Blocker on POST /getStageGuidance
- **Error**: `Input should be 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'; symptom_severity_max received: 'none'`
- **Root cause**: At least one entry in `stages.yaml` uses `symptom_severity_max: none`, which is not a valid enum value.

🔧 Next: Investigating stage config and fix in YAML or engine logic.
