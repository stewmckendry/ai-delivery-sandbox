## 🧾 Final Summary – Task 3.2_execute_e2e_scenarios

### ✅ Objective
Simulate and validate end-to-end user journeys through CareerCoach-GPT, ensuring prompts, journaling, segment fetching, and memory tools function smoothly. All testing was conducted via the **CareerCoach custom GPT**, not backend API calls.

---

### 🧪 Tests Run
1. [Explorer Flow – Dream Job](https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/tree/sandbox-silent-otter/test/e2e/test_results_01_explorer_gpt_simulation.md)
2. [Explorer Flow – STEM (Curiosity Lab)](https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/tree/sandbox-silent-otter/test/e2e/test_results_02_explorer_stem_gpt_simulation.md)

Both included full journaling, GPT responses, reflection capture, and summary retrieval.

---

### ✅ Successes
- Prompts loaded with engaging intros and 5-question sequences
- GPT synthesized answers into vivid narratives
- Reflections saved to **Notion** and **Airtable**
- GPT confirmed when data was saved

---

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- `career_id` was not passed in either test's `record_reflection` tool call
- Airtable field for `career_id` was blank
- User plans to update the OpenAPI schema to make `career_id` required

---

### 🧠 Insights
- Custom GPT experience felt magical and intuitive
- Data pipeline to Notion and Airtable worked smoothly
- GPT needs better hinting or schema enforcement to include all required fields

---

### 🏁 Status
✅ Task complete — tests passed with minor schema fix needed for full compliance.

Great job validating real-world use through GPT!
