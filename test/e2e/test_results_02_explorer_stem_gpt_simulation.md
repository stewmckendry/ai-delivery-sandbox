- **Prompt Used**: `curiosity_lab`
- **User Answers**:
  - Big question: How do they get the Caramilk in the Caramilk bar?
  - Job: Chocolate Connoisseur

  - Discovery: Best chocolate + filling combo
  - Sharing: All friends — "Chocolate for life!"
- **Reflection Title Given**: The Sweet Science Explorer
- **Reflection Saved**: ✅ Confirmed in Notion + Airtable
- **Career Field**: ❌ Still blank — GPT did not pass `career_id`

### ✅ Passed
- Excellent user engagement and STEM-themed interaction
- GPT correctly walked through the Q&A sequence
- Final story generated and saved in warm, creative tone

### ⚠️ Known Issue
- Despite user asking GPT to suggest a career name, the tool call didn’t include `career_id`

### 🧠 Follow-Up Action
- Updating the OpenAPI schema to **require** `career_id` is a smart fix — should enforce compliance in tool calls
