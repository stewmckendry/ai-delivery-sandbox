Purpose\nThe Open Government Guidebook was originally developed in 2018, through collaboration with\nworking group members from over 25 Government of Canada (GC) departments. Through\nconsultations with many of these departments from 2020 to 2021, this guide was updated to reflect\nthe most recent international practices in open government. It aims to provide direction, best\npractices and tools to learn more about open government processes for the GC. It also outlines\nimplementation guidance for relevant policy instruments including the Policy on Service and Digital,\nthe Guideline on Service and Digital and the Directive on Open Government – all of which help ensure\nconsistent approaches to open data and information practices across government.\nThis guidebook reflects the 2023-2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service and Digital\nStandards, which form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile and open,\nwith user-focused approaches. Like Canada’s Digital Ambition, they recognize data and information\nas “assets” that can be leveraged to create better community outcomes, particularly when made\navailable for public reuse.\nThis guidebook is based on the international Open Data Charter, which established the following six\nprinciples to consider and apply when publishing open data and information:\nFigure 1: Open data charter principles\nThe intended audiences for this guidebook are those in roles that support open government within\ntheir organization, including but not limited to:\n• chief information/data/security officer and staff\n• IM/IT managers\n• open government coordinators\n• geospatial specialists\n• privacy/security specialists\n4\n• data custodians, stewards and managers\n• researchers and scientists\n• business owners\n• others with a role in data and information management and dissemination\nThe Open Government Guidebook will be evergreen, and it will continue to be updated to reflect\nthe current open government practices for the GC. Feedback and suggestions for updates can be\nsent to open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca.\n5\n1.2. Context\n1.2.1.

The Policy on Service and Digital and the Directive on Open Government\nThe Policy on Service and Digital requires that GC departments:\n• 4.3.2.8 Maximize the release of departmental information and data as an open resource,\ndiscoverable through the Government of Canada open government portal designated by the\nTreasury Board of Canada Secretariat, while respecting information security, privacy, and\nlegal considerations;\n• 4.3.2.9 Prioritize departmental information and data to be added to the Government of\nCanada’s open government portal, informed by public demand.\nFurther guidance on these requirements can be found in the Guideline on Service and Digital, which\nprovides specific details on open government policy requirements. The Directive on Open\nGovernment is a policy tool under the Policy on Service and Digital that promotes the release of\ngovernment information and data of high value to support transparency, accountability, public\nengagement and socio-economic benefits through reuse, while ensuring that security and privacy\nlegal and policy requirements are met.\nInformation and data are of high value if they can be integrated or analyzed across programs,\nsectors, and geographic locations to help highlight trends; identify social and economic conditions\nand inequities; and help address global challenges such as poverty, hunger, climate change, and\ninequality.\nEngage your IM and data management teams early: Information and data of\nhigh value should be managed in designated corporate repositories (such as\nMicrosoft 365) to facilitate accessing relevant data and information for\npublishing to the portal. If available, leverage automated tools in support of\ngood IM and data practices, particularly during clean-up activities. For further\nguidance, visit the IM Toolkit.\nIn releasing effective and timely information and data of high value to the public, GC departments\ncan help individuals, businesses, and departments develop new insights and innovative ideas that\ncan generate social and economic benefits, empower marginalized communities, and improve the\nlives of people.\nThe expected results of the Directive on Open Government are that Canadians can find and use GC\ninformation and data to:\n• support accountability\n• facilitate value-added analysis\n• drive socio-economic benefits through reuse, while respecting security and privacy legal and\npolicy considerations\n7\n• support meaningful engagement with their government\nThe Directive on Open Government is currently undergoing an update and is expected to be\napproved during 2023.\n1.2.3. The Open Government Portal\nSince 2011, the Open Government Portal has evolved to provide one-stop access to the GC’s\nsearchable open data, open information and open maps assets. The platform is built using open\nsource tools and a cloud-based architecture, which enables scalability and adaptability to the\ngrowing requirements of open.canada.ca.\nThe Open Government Portal provides a central and authoritative source for data and information,\npublished by departments through the Open Government Registry. To publish on the Open\nGovernment Portal, members of departments must create an Open Government Registry profile.\nSeek help: Contact open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca for advice and technical assistance\nwhen publishing your open assets on the Open Government Portal.\nOpen data is powering innovations across the country. Used as a resource, data can be transformed\nfrom numbers and values to insight, making it easier for people to discover, learn and make\ninformed decisions. Explore our Open Data User Stories to get a sense of how Canadians – from\nstudents to business owners to government departments – are using open data, what they are\ndoing with it and its impact on communities. These stories allow us to gain a better understanding\nof how open data and information can help to make a difference in the lives of Canadians.\ni. Open information\nThe Directive on Open Government defines open information as any digital material that is often\ncreated in free-form text using common desktop applications such as email, word processing, or\npresentation applications and is freely shared without restrictions. The Open Government Portal\ngrants access to all of the GC’s mandatory reporting documents (e.g., reports to Parliament,\nproactive disclosure reports). In addition, all documents posted online or planned for publication via\ndepartmental websites or print (e.g., statistical reports, educational videos, event photos,\norganizational charts) should also be made open by default, by releasing them as open information\non open.canada.ca. This includes summaries of completed access to information requests.\nii. Summaries of completed access to information requests\nThe Access to Information Act gives Canadian citizens, permanent residents and any person or\ncorporation present in Canada a right to access records of government departments that are\nsubject to the Act. Additionally, the Directive on Access to Information Requests contains policy\nrequirements and guidance for departments to publicly post summaries of completed access to\ninformation (ATI) requests. The Open Government Portal allows users to search summaries of\n8\ncompleted ATI requests to find information about ATI requests previously made to the GC. Users\ncan submit an informal request for the package.\nFor organizations that want to submit their access to information summaries to open.canada.ca,\nrefer to this ATI Summaries Training Guide (internal link).\nPu blish information and data: Release any ATI summaries and any data you have\npublished on your departmental website on the Open Government Portal to best\nserve Canadians (see figure 4 for more information on why this is important).\niii. Proactive publication\nThe GC has implemented a series of measures to enhance the transparency and oversight of public\ninformation in the federal government. By making this information readily available, Canadians and\nParliament are better able to hold the government and public sector officials to account.\nOne of these measures included enshrining certain proactive publication requirements in legislation\nunder Part 2 of the Access to Information Act. The legislative requirements for proactive publication\nby ministers and government departments include:\n• briefing packages prepared for new or incoming ministers and deputy heads\n• briefing packages prepared for a minister or deputy head’s appearance before a\nparliamentary committee\n• contracts over $10,000\n• grants and contributions over $25,000\n• hospitality expenses\n• position reclassifications\n• reports tabled in Parliament\n• titles and reference numbers of memoranda (briefing notes)\n• travel expenses\n• Question Period notes prepared for ministers\nProactive publication under Part 2 of the ATIA would not require the release of information that\nwould properly be withheld in a response to an access to information request, such as personal\ninformation or Cabinet confidences. For further guidance around the proactive publication\nrequirements under Part 2 of the ATIA, consult ATI/PP - GCpedia or contact the Treasury Board of\nCanada Secretariat (TBS) Access to Information Policy and Performance Division.\nAnother measure includes those proactive disclosures that are mandated by TBS policy and acts:\n• Access to information summaries (see the Directive on Access to Information Requests)\n9\n• Acts of founded wrongdoing (see Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act)\n• Annual expenditures on travel, hospitality and conference (see the Directive on Travel,\nHospitality, Conference and Event Expenditures)\n• Departmental Audit Committees (see the Directive on Internal Audit)\n• Grants and contributions of all values (see the Guidelines on the Reporting of Grants and\nContributions Awards)\nFinally, open government provides GC departments with the opportunity to identify other\ninformation for release and maximize the release of information to the public. For proactive\ndisclosures that are not required under the Access to Information Act, the exemptions and\nexclusions set out in the ATIA can still provide useful indicators of what type of information is not\nappropriate for release.\niv. The Federal Geospatial Platform and Open Maps\nThe Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP) provides access to the most comprehensive collections of\naccurate and authoritative geospatial information from GC departments, as well as the provinces\nand territories. Geospatial content is made available to the public and others in a coherent manner\nthat enables the government’s most relevant information to be spatially displayed, managed and\nanalyzed in a visual context. Using maps, users can produce value-added products and applications,\ndrive innovation and enhance decision-making in support of government priorities.\nGeospatial or location-based data are implicitly linked to a geographic position, such as a street\naddress, town, jurisdictional boundary, or any other geographic feature. such as coastlines or rivers.\nThis data can be used to support national priorities, such as economic growth, social well-being,\nflooding, emergencies and environmental protection. The full potential of open data can be realized\nthrough combining, visualizing and analyzing geospatial data, along with other GC data holdings, to\npropel sound decision-making. It is important to highlight that geospatial or location-based data\nand metadata can be considered personal information and should be treated accordingly.\nDepartments are encouraged to consult with their access to information and privacy offices and\ntheir privacy management units when considering the release of or access to such data.\nOpen Maps provides access to the GC’s geospatial information. Federal departments with\ngeospatial data holdings will register metadata and publish datasets and services on the FGP.\nGeospatial data and maps services eligible for release under the Open Government Licence are\nshared automatically through the Open Government and Open Maps Portals.\nLe verage the power of place: Publish geo-enabled datasets containing addresses,\nge ographic coordinates, or other location information on the Open Maps Portal to\nm aximize their potential.\nFor more information and to publish data on the FGP/Open Maps, visit https://gcgeo.gc.ca or email\nthe FGP at nrcan.geoinfo.rncan@canada.ca.\n10\nv. Suggest a Dataset\nThe Suggest a Dataset service is available on the Open Government Portal and was created to\nincrease government transparency and foster trust by providing anyone in the public sphere with\nthe opportunity to request the data and information they want. The service can accelerate the\ncreation of potentially life-saving products and benefits because it allows the public to directly\nsuggest datasets that are of most value to them and should be published on the Open Government\nPortal. Departments that own the data are then held accountable for responding to suggestions by\nproviding status updates on the work being conducted for their release. All this information is\npublished on the Open Government Portal so that the public can see whether suggested datasets\nare indeed active and/or underway to publication.\nWhen attempting to identify the assets they wish to release, data owners and publishers should\nprioritize the publishing of these publicly valued datasets. Departments should note that release is\ndependent on security and privacy legislative, as well as policy requirements.\nThe TBS Open Government and Portals team will notify departments of suggested datasets through\nemail communications to the departmental open government coordinators. Thereafter,\ndepartments are required to update the status related to a specific suggested dataset within three\nbusiness weeks.\nFor more information on the public dataset requests assigned to your organization on the Open\nGovernment Portal, write to open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca.\n1.2.4. The Open Government Registry\nThe Open Government Registry is the Open Government Portal’s backend. It is an internal metadata\ncatalogue used by GC departments to manage and release data and information to open.canada.ca.\nLike the Open Government Portal, it uses open-source tools and a cloud-based architecture, which\nenables scalability and adaptability to the growing requirements of open.canada.ca.\nReady, set, publish: To publish open data and information on the Open\nGovernment Portal, create an Open Government Registry account.\n11\nTo publish on the Open Government Portal, users must create an Open Government Registry\nprofile. Visit the Open Government Registry FAQ for more information on our registry.\nFigure 3: The open government portal\nHelpful links and resources\n• All of the source code for open.canada.ca is available for reuse on GitHub\n• Open Government Portal - Functional Specifications - User Interface\n• Open Government Registry Guide\n• Open Government Portal Analytics\n• GC InfoBase\n1.2.5. The Open Government Licence – Canada\nThe Open Government Licence – Canada (OGL-Canada) is a licensing agreement that can be used by\nany public body in Canada in provincial, territorial, or municipal governments. It states that the\nCrown grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive access to use the information,\nincluding for commercial purposes, as long as the licence requirements are respected, including the\n12\nattribution requirements. It does not grant rights to use third party information that the provider is\nnot authorized to license.\nAs such, before releasing materials on the Open Government Portal, departments should ensure the\nintellectual property is owned by the Government of Canada, meaning that the government has\npermanent permission or authority to share the resource under an open government licence, or has\nbeen granted a licensed, non-exclusive right to publicly disseminate the asset. This includes material\nunder Crown copyright. Consult your internal Intellectual Property team for more information.\nNote that although the OGL-Canada allows the user to copy, modify, publish, translate, adapt,\ndistribute or otherwise use the data and information in any medium, mode or format for any lawful\npurpose, the user must identify the source of the data on their derived products.\nU nderstand the licence: Get familiar with Canada’s Open Government Licence to\ne nsure that you own the rights and/or have secured sufficient rights to make your\nm aterial available to the public.\nThe OGL-Canada is designed to provide public bodies across Canada with a consistent means of\nlicensing their information and data. This consistency reduces barriers to publication and avoids the\ncost of each public body developing its own licence. Perhaps most significant is that wider adoption\nof the licence will make it simpler to combine information from different public bodies because the\nlicence terms will be compatible.\nThe goals of the Open Government Licence are to:\n• provide the broadest possible use of the licensed material\n• ensure that the licence is easily understood by end users and public bodies\n• ensure that the licence is simple to adopt by other public bodies\n• facilitate the broad use of data by ensuring that licence terms are compatible across\njurisdictions\nAchieving these goals is only possible when public bodies who want to use the licence adopt it as it\nwas intended. This means the licence text is unchanged, except for specific items that are meant to\nbe changed to suit the individual public body and their respective jurisdiction, such as to reflect\ndifferences in organization between federal and provincial or municipal governments.\nThe OGL-Canada grants similar rights to users as the Creative Commons Licence. The OGL-Canada\nhas been internationally recognized as a Conformant License by the Open Knowledge Foundation\nwith the same rights granted to users as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC\nBY 4.0.). The main difference is that the OGL-Canada was designed specifically for GC data and\ninformation, and requires amendments to be applied to data/information not owned by the GC.\n13\n1.2.6. TBS open government departmental support\nTBS open government team provides support to departments through a number of committees. The\nOpen Government Coordinators Working Group (OGCWG), the Open Government Director General\nWorking Group (OGDG), and the Canadian Open Government Community of Practice all meet on a\nmonthly basis to strengthen collaboration on open government initiatives and open data policies\nacross various levels of government and across federal departments. For more information on\ncommittee meetings, visit the GCcollab page, and to find out how to join this community, write to\nopen-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca.\nJo in the community: The monthly Open Government Coordinators Working Group\nprovides tips to help advance open government principles in your organization and\nis a forum to exchange best practices with your open government peers.\n2. How to release and publish open data and information on the\nOpen Government Portal\nFigure 4: How to release and publish open data and information on the Open Government Portal\n14\n2.1. Understand what should be released\nStep\n1\n2.1.1. Why → The Policy on Service and Digital states that departments are required to\nmaximize the release of open data and information by ensuring that all asset\ncategories specified below are considered for release, via the Open Government\nPortal:\n• Open data and maps: All data and geospatial assets held by GC departments are to be open by\ndefault and released as open data, while respecting information security, privacy, and legal\nconsiderations.\nD esign for open by default: When designing initiatives, consider how data and\nin formation governance can help you incorporate openness in your planning. For\nm ore on Governance see Appendix B.\n• Open information: Any information that is freely shared without restriction, including all\nmandatory proactive disclosures (e.g., proactive publications under Part 2 of the ATIA, proactive\ndisclosure reports) and all documents posted online or planned for publication via departmental\nwebsites or print (e.g., statistical reports, educational videos, event photos, organizational\ncharts). These are to be open by default and released as open information under an open\ngovernment licence, while respecting information security, privacy, and legal considerations.\nIn ventory your data: An internal data inventory exercise can help identify your\norganization’s data to determine what can be released as open data.\n15\nFigure 5: Why publish to the Open Government Portal\n16\n2.1.2. What → Here is the release scheme with six categories of open information that GC\ndepartments typically release:\nAbout Our Our\nus finances services\nDepartmental/agency Financial information (projected and A description of services offered,\ninformation, location(s), actual income and expenditures, including publications, transactions,\ncon tacts, constitutional and legal tendering, procurement and contracts, grants and contributions, and media\ngovernance travel and hospitality, position releases\nreclassifications, annual report of\nminister’s office expenses)\nOur Our Our\npriorities policies lists\nStrategy and performance Protocols for delivering your Information held in registers\nin formation, assessments and functions and responsibilities, required by legislation, and other\nreviews, reports tabled in policy proposals and lists and registers relating to your\nParliament announcements, decision-making functions, summaries of completed\nprocesses, consultations access to information requests\nStep\n2.2. Prioritize identified assets for release\n2\n2.2.1. What → High-value information and data should be prioritized for release and can\nbe determined by:\n• most importantly: public demand (refer to the Suggest a Dataset section)\n• frequent internal usage\n• a large volume of external requests on a specific topic (ATI requests or other)\n• a significance to historical or ongoing operations of the department/agency\n17\n2.2.2. How → the prioritization toolkit: Scoring assets against a specific set of criteria may\nalso prove to be helpful.\nFigure 6: The prioritization toolkit\n18\ni. To use the prioritization toolkit:\n• Consider that specified data and information that are mandated for publication under Part 2 of\nthe Access to Information Act (ATIA) or TBS policy must be the top priority for release, regardless\nof how they are scored using this toolkit.\n• For all other data and information assets eligible for release, rate each asset against the criteria\nbelow, by adding one point for each true statement.\n• Assess the overall scores for your assets in descending order to identify which assets should be\nmost prioritized for release.\n1. Value: The asset is relevant, usable, and useful to external parties, and/or helps to improve\naccountability and transparency, while respecting information security, privacy, and legal\nconsiderations.\nService to the public Public engagement Public interest\nAssign points to information and Assign points to information Assign points to information\ndata that provides benefits to and data that will help the and data that has been\nthe public. public meaningfully engage frequently requested\n• The asset helps improve in ongoing and current through an ATI request.\nservices discussions. • The asset contains\n• The asset allows for innovation • The asset raises key information that is\nand economic growth questions surrounding a frequently sought through\ntopic of current public the ATI process\ndiscussion • The asset is associated\n• The asset advances with a subject matter area\ndialogue and/or provides of high social interest\ninsight on an issue of • The asset adds value to a\npublic concern particular topic of public\nconcern\nGovernment transparency and Reuse potential Government efficiency\ninternational priorities Assign points to information Assign points to information\nAssign points to information and and data that can be easily and data that will provide\ndata that will allow the public to updated. value to other GC\nbetter understand GC priorities • The asset is frequently departments and provide\nand commitments. updated more effective services.\n• The asset is relevant to current • The asset can help fuel • The asset’s release could\nGC priorities and commitments innovation and economic help provide more efficient\n• The asset aligns with priorities growth government services\n• The asset has been • The asset’s release could\npreviously requested help highlight areas in\nthrough the Suggest a need of greater efficiency\nDataset service on the in government services\nopen government portal\n• The asset is highly sought\nafter through other means\n19\n2.

Effort: Determining how the asset’s release supports the commitments captured in the GC’s\nNational Action Plans on Open Government is a good way of ensuring that milestones are\nachieved, to address the issues of importance to the peoples of Canada.\n21\nIdentify what should not be released → Sometimes departments and agencies are unable to\nrelease data or information because it is subject to certain restrictions, such as Cabinet\nconfidences, solicitor–client privilege, personal information, classified or protected information,\nadvice, recommendations, third party information, or information obtained in confidence.\nNote: The Release Checklist provides more guidance on the data and information that can be\npublished. Do not release or publish assets that contain information that is not able to be\nreleased to the public due to security, privacy or licensing concerns, or which GC departments\ndo not have the authority to release, such as the following.\nii. Privacy, personal information and confidentiality\nSubsection 8(1) of the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of personal information under the control\nof a government department, except in accordance with the exceptions set out in subsection 8(2). A\ndataset or information that contains personal information about an individual must not be\ndisclosed on the Open Government Portal.\nPersonal information, as defined by the Privacy Act, is information about an identifiable individual\nthat is recorded in any form. This definition applies to both a single information record or a\ncombination of available information records that may render an individual identifiable. This\nincludes but is not limited to information about:\n• race\n• national or ethnic origin\n• religion\n• age\n• marital status\n• medical, criminal or employment history\nSufficiently anonymized data – that is, information that had once been personal, but has been\nirreversibly and permanently modified so that there is no reasonable expectation that the individual\ncan be identified – can be released. However, departments must ensure that individuals cannot be\nre-identified directly or indirectly, either through that dataset alone or in combination with other\navailable information. Departments must consult with their access to information and privacy\noffices and their privacy management units when considering the publication of such information.\nBe mindfully open: Ensure that your release process includes privacy, security, and\nlegal considerations to publish open data and information safely.\nAn asset that provides information about vulnerable populations may pose a privacy risk. For\nexample, individuals who belong to smaller minority groups may be easily identified when\n22\ncombining data points across various assets. In some cases, even a postal code combined with a\nsingle piece of sensitive data can reveal an identity, breach privacy, and potentially cause harm.\nDepartments must remain attuned to vulnerable groups to safeguard information appropriately,\nparticularly given the push to collect Gender-Based Analysis Plus information and greater\ndisaggregated data.\nDepartments may still be able to release assets that contain these sorts of information elements by\nanonymizing the data so that it no longer contains personal information; that is, there is no\nreasonable expectation that the individual can be identified directly or indirectly by any means or\nperson. It should be noted that section 3(j) of the Privacy Act allows the disclosure of personal\ninformation under specific exemptions. Departments must take necessary measures to protect\nagainst the release of personal and de-identified information.\nAn asset may breach confidentiality if its release impairs a government’s ability to make decisions.\nExamples include:\n• court rulings or police investigations\n• budget and policy decisions that may impact financial markets\n• negotiations, such as collective bargaining or international trade agreements\n• Cabinet confidences\n• solicitor–client privileges, advice, or recommendations\n• personal, classified, or protected information\n• third party information or information obtained in confidence\nFor additional guidance on confidentiality, personal information, access to information and privacy\nrequirements, consult your internal ATIP Coordinator and/or Chief Privacy Office.\niii. Security\nAn asset that provides information about vulnerable or targeted individuals or departments may\nalso pose security risks. Examples of these assets may include:\n• information related to policing activities\n• information about vulnerable groups, such as prison guards\nDepartments should ensure that the data or information asset does not increase security risks to\nthe government as a whole and conforms to the requirements of the Policy on Government Security\nand its related instruments.\niv. Supporting Indigenous Data Sovereignty\nData on Indigenous Peoples and communities have historically been collected in a colonial context,\nand unilateral efforts by the federal government to publish those data can be viewed as a\ncontinuation of that colonial legacy. The Government of Canada recognizes this reality, and will\ncontinue to work with Indigenous Peoples to support their self-determination in the data sphere.\nThis work includes determining:\n• how to identify data related to Indigenous lands and Peoples that are included in federal\ndata holdings;\n23\n• how best to support Indigenous data capacity to collect, manage, use, and share their data\nas they see fit;\n• and to actively participate in, contribute to, and benefit from stronger, more inclusive and\ninterconnected information and statistical systems in Canada.\nThe GC is committed to nation-to-nation relationships with Indigenous Peoples. The various\nelements of open government, including open policy-making and open data, have different\nimplications when considering data related to First Nations, Inuit and Métis governments,\norganizations, and Peoples. As the Government of Canada continues to work with Indigenous\npartners to advance nation-to-nation relationships, reconciliation, and Indigenous self-\ndetermination, Indigenous data sovereignty is an important part of the conversation.\nThe 2023–2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service includes Support for Indigenous data\nsovereignty as one of five desired outcomes, and advancement of a whole-of-government approach\nto the management and sharing of Indigenous data as an area for action. As work towards these\ngoals continues, federal departments and agencies are encouraged to inform themselves on\nwhether and how opening their data holdings might impact Indigenous Peoples. This may include:\n• Learning about the First Nations Principles of OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access and\nPossession) and the First Nations Data Governance Strategy published by the First Nations\nInformation Governance Centre; as well as and the data priorities (Priority Area 4) in the\nNational Inuit Strategy on Research published by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.\n• Connecting with officials in your department responsible for Indigenous services or\nrelationships, and/or with Indigenous Services Canada, who can provide more information on\nongoing efforts to support Indigenous data sovereignty and capacity, including the\nTransformational Approach to Indigenous Data, and opportunities to share best practices,\nincluding the Interdepartmental Collaborative Committee on Indigenous Data that Indigenous\nServices Canada and Statistics Canada co-chair.\n• Working with and co-developing approaches with Indigenous Peoples wherever possible.\nSupport Indigenous Sovereignty: get informed on whether and how opening data\nholdings might impact Indigenous Peoples by learning about the First Nations\nPrinciples of OCAP and the National Inuit Strategy on Research; by connecting\nwith your internal Indigenous Services group; and by working to co-develop\napproaches with Indigenous people wherever possible.\nv. Legal and contractual limitations\nAn asset may be subject to legal or contractual agreements that prevent it from being released.\nAgreements may include:\n• limitations in data-sharing agreements and memoranda of understanding\n• third party data (departments that collect data for federal use, but the organization may not\nhave the rights to publish it on open.canada.ca)\n• commercial licence (data purchased from third parties that may have limited rights for\ndistribution)\n24\n• vendor limitations (data that is delivered under a contract that captures exclusions for extracting\nand manipulating data)\n• non-disclosure agreements\n• solicitor–client privilege\nEnsure that the department has the mandate, legislative authority, or permission from a third party\nprovider (if applicable) to publish the data or information asset under the Open Government\nLicence – Canada. Your legal team will be able to help you assess data and information to determine\nwhether there are other legal issues.\n2.2.3. Who → roles and responsibilities: GC departments are responsible for the\nassessment of their respective data and information before seeking approval for\nrelease. Here are the stakeholders in the assessment process (may differ from\ndepartment to department, depending on size and organizational structure):\nEnterprise data Chief Business owner Information Departmental\nstewards and data/information (DG-level) Technology open\ncustodians officer Identifies data and Services government\nContains the Previously known information assets Recommends, coordinator\nsubject matter as the Information eligible for release designs, develops, Helps content\nexpertise in a Management and ensures that the and tests tools to owners with the\nbusiness line or Senior Official criteria for release convert the release process\ndata domain and is (IMSO), is has been carefully department\'s (e.g., identification,\nresponsible for considered and that information into preparation,\nresponsible for\nmeeting the appropriate machine-readable approval\nmanaging\nenterprise data\nr\na\ne\ns\nq\nso\nu\nc\nir\nia\ne\nt\nm\ned\nen\nw\nts\nit h\nc\nsu\no\nb\nn\nj\ns\ne\nu\nc\nl\nt\nt a\nm\nti\na\no\nt\nn\nt\ns\ne r\nw ith f\nw\no\ni\nr\nt\nm\nh\na\no\nt\np\ns\ne\nt\nn\nh a\nd\nt\na\nc\nta\no mply m\nen\ne\nt\nc\nry\nh a\nin\nn\nt\nis\no\nm\nth\ns\ne\na n\nO\nd\np en\nacross its lifecycle. their role, as noted experts (e.g. ATIP, formats.

For example, a plain text file does not have formatting capabilities and a Word version of\nthe information may be provided as print-ready alternative (in addition to the plain text file (TXT)).\nAccessible PDFs: Check whether your open information PDF asset is accessible by\nrunning an accessibility report.\n30\nHelpful links and resources\nFor more information, access our DRAFT Open government data and information quality standards.\nBe long, not wide: In a well-structured dataset, each row should be an observation\nof the data and each column should be a variable that describes that observation =\nlong data (correct). Wide data (incorrect) formatting may be popular within\npublications, but it will normally require a user to transpose the data before they\ncan do analysis or create visualizations.\nBoost comparability and interoperability: Adhere to the Open Data Charter (ODC)\nprinciples by ensuring that open datasets use common reference data standards\nwhere appropriate. For example, those referencing Provinces and Territories\nshould make use of the Reference data standard on Canadian provinces and\nterritories.\n2.4. Obtain approval\nStep\n4\nRelease Checklist → To support departments in managing the risks related to releasing data and\ninformation assets, TBS has developed a Release Checklist that consolidates common release\nexceptions. Open government data publishers must ensure that an answer of “true” can be given for\neach criterion prior to seeking release approvals. Final approval for release onto the Open Government\nPortal may be delegated from the designated departmental authority once departments have\nestablished a release process. This includes departments determining delegation for new datasets\nwithin business lines and updating existing assets on the portal. For more information on delegation of\nauthorities see Appendix B: Governance.\nAlways be documenting: As a tool for the open government principles of\naccountability and transparency, when seeking approvals include the Release\nC hecklist, along with any documentation that shows how each criterion has been\nmet.\n31\nRelease Checklist True False\nConfidentiality: Confidentiality requirements have been considered and the asset is free of\n☐ ☐\nany relevant concerns, for example, Cabinet confidences, solicitor–client privilege, personal\ninformation, classified/protected information, advice, recommendations, third party\ni nformation or information obtained in confidence.\nAuthority to release: The department has the mandate, legislative authority or permission ☐ ☐\nfrom a third party provider to release the data or information asset under the Open\nG overnment Licence – Canada.\nFormats: The asset is in an open and accessible format that complies with the Standard on ☐ ☐\nWeb Accessibility.\nPrivacy: The asset is free of any personal information, as defined in section 3 of the Privacy ☐ ☐\nAct.\nOfficial languages: The asset is available in both official languages and conforms to the ☐ ☐\nrequirements of the Official Languages Act.\nSecurity: Security requirements have been considered and the asset is free of any risk to\n☐ ☐\nthe department, to other departments, or to the government as a whole and conforms to\nthe requirements of the Policy on Government Security and its related instruments.\nOther – legal/regulatory/policy/contractual: The release of data or other information\nassets complies with all other relevant legal, regulatory, contractual and policy ☐ ☐\nrequirements (e.g., it is confirmed that there are no relevant legal, contractual, third party\nor policy restrictions or limitations).\nGovernance is key: Create a monthly internal open data working group to identify\nyour organization’s open data assets, create a network that fosters collaboration\nand share best practices.\n32\n2.5. Release the identified assets Step\n5\nTo add a dataset or information on the Open Government Portal via the Open Government Registry\n(internal link), you will first need to request an account by completing the Request an Account form\nfound on the Registry log in page. Your account will be activated and linked to your organization.\nYou will then be able to create or modify records in the Open Government Registry. Departments\nact as publishing agents for records. This means records are released by and belong to an\norganization rather than individual registry users.\nNote: While departments may choose to continue publishing content to their departmental sites,\nthey should also be publishing this data and information to open.canada.ca. This can be\naccomplished by linking to the departmental site, rather than duplicating the publication. See the\nWhy section for more on the benefits of releasing data to the Open Government Portal.\nThe Open Government Registry Guide provides details on the required steps to release an asset on\nopen.canada.ca. To add a geospatial dataset on the Open Government/Open Maps Portal, visit\nhttps://gcgeo.gc.ca/en or contact NRCan.fgp-pgf.RNCan@canada.ca.\nHTTPS all day: If publishing open data by putting files on a departmental server,\nensure that the links in your datasets are HTTPS. If they are not, users will not\nbe able to access them; Google Chrome now blocks HTTP links since upgrading\nto version 89. For new publications, it is recommended that publishers upload\ntheir data files directly into the Open Government Registry to avoid issues\nassociated with linking.\nStep\n2.6. Manage released assets\n6\n2.6.1. Organizing a metadata record\nIt is recommended that you bundle similar datasets/information assets together and create one\nmetadata record in the Open Government Registry, rather than creating a record for each individual\nasset.\nFor example, datasets that are released annually or in subsets should be added to the same record.\nOne record can be created to describe the datasets, but individual assets (or files) can be added in\nbulk by using the “Add a Resource” form in the Open Government Registry.\nThere is no limit to the number of assets that can be added to a single metadata record.\nRefer to the following datasets as an example:\n33\n• Breaking datasets up by year: Fuel consumption ratings\n• Breaking datasets up into related subsets: The Canadian Nutrient File: Nutrient Value of Some\nCommon Foods\nAlso refer to the Open Government Metadata Application Profile and the GC Standard on Metadata\nfor more information.\nMetadata matters: Use plain language, avoid abbreviations and acronyms, begin\nthe title with the name or subject of the asset, and ensure that the title of the\ndataset does not exceed 70 characters and that the dataset is fully translated and\naccessible.\n2.6.2. Minor updates\nSimilar to adding multiple subsets of data together, updates can be added as an additional asset on\nyour record. Or you can replace the current version of the asset with the updated version. If you are\nreplacing the file, we would recommend providing information in the description on the metadata\nrecord or as an additional file to explain to users what has been updated or changed.\n2.6.3. Open government APIs and digital accessibility\nOpen Government Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be accessed to automate the\npublication and update of assets on the Open Government Portal. APIs can be beneficial when\nmanaging datasets and/or proactive disclosures on the Portal by allowing departments to:\n• apply bulk changes to multiple datasets\n• automatically generate and update datasets\n• upload proactive disclosures that originate from another system of record\nOpen Government APIs: To perform bulk dataset uploads and to automate\nupdates, explore the integration of Open Government APIs by liaising with your\ninternal technical representatives. For help, write to us at open-ouvert@tbs-\nsct.gc.ca.\nUsing an API does not require an all-or-nothing approach. Rather, users benefit from its use for\nsome tasks, while the user interface can be used for others. This includes the publication of data\nfrom departmental sites and databases to the Open Government Portal, where the information\nbecomes discoverable in a central location.\n34\nFor more training and information on how you can benefit from the power of open government\nAPIs, consult the Open Government GCcollab Learning Space.\n2.6.4. Open Government Analytics\nOpen Government Analytics are available to support departmental open government coordinators\nin their roles to track and report on the progress of open government deliverables and key\nperformance indicators (KPIs).\nAnalytics are your friend: To gauge how Canadians are using your open data, refer\nto your departmental Open Government Analytics.\n2.7. Create a strategy to promote assets Step\n7\nSupporting open data and information with outreach and engagement activities can significantly\nincrease the value for both users and curators. We encourage data and information curators to\nwork with their local communications shops to develop an outreach and engagement strategy for\nopen government.\nConnect with comms: Work with your internal communications shops to promote\nn ewly released open datasets on the Open Government Portal and reach a larger\na udience.\nApproaches range from the very light-touch and community-focused to more formal campaigns.\nHere are some ideas:\n• Develop a central open government email account to manage inquiries and comments on\nreleased dataset and information assets\n• Maintain a distribution list of data stakeholders and send emails highlighting new/changed data\nholdings\n• Host digital information or Q&A sessions on data holdings (e.g., Statistics Canada’s (StatCan)\nChat with an Expert series)\n• Present at open data or open government meet-ups, committees and working groups,\nhackathons, conferences, university seminars or other community events\n• Blog or provide featured maps on open.canada.ca\n35\n• Collaborate regularly with internal communications shops to strategize and foster this essential\nrelationship (social media, blogs, GCTools, newsletters, cross-promotion opportunities, etc.)\n• Meet directly with data stakeholders, virtually or in person, for feedback and discussion\n• Contact academics or social policy NGOs with an interest in the field\n• Seek input on community needs and priorities\nG ain knowledge and sharpen skills: For open government–related training, refer\nto the Open Government GCcollab page, Apolitical, Stat Can’s Data Literacy\nCatalogue and Canada School of Public Service.\n2.8. Maintain assets on an ongoing basis Step\n8\nThe public and organizations across Canada rely on the Open Government Portal to fuel innovation and\nbusiness. As a result, any change to a given data or information asset may have larger implications to\nasset by-products and critical business lines. For this reason, it is important to consider the impact on\nthe user when changes are made either to the content that your department has released or the\nmetadata describing it.\nAn important part of hosting data and information on the Open Government Portal is ensuring that it\nremains useable and accurate. This includes managing both the content released and the metadata\nrecords associated with them in the Open Government Registry and requires consideration of how the\noriginal sources themselves are managed. We recommend periodically testing the links and files in your\nrecord to ensure that they can be consistently and seamlessly accessed by users. This is particularly\nimportant for html links, where the web pages may change over time. Additionally, activities related to\ncreating the consultation version or copy for release online should be documented to support\ndepartmental information management and version control.\nSeek guidance from your internal information management office for more information on life-cycle\nmanagement and version control.\nStay current: Test your Open Government Portal records regularly and keep your\ndata and information assets updated to ensure they remain accurate and\nseamlessly useable.\n36\n2.8.1. The openness rating\nThe Open Government Portal allots an openness rating as an indicator of how open data and\ninformation assets are. These ratings are on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and serve as useful guidelines for\nmaintaining assets on the open government portal.\nThe resource is available on the Web\n★ (whatever format) under an open\nlicence\nThe resource is available as structured\n★★ data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan\nof a table)\nThe resource uses non-proprietary\n★★★\nformats (e.g., CSV instead of Excel)\nThe resource uses URIs (uniform\n★★★★ resource identifiers) to denote things,\nso that people can point at your stuff\nThe resources links data to other\n★★★★★\ndatasets to provide context\nFurther information on the costs and benefits of the openness rating can be found at Openness\nRating | Open Government, Government of Canada.\nMost assets on the Open Government Portal are rated with either one star (70%) or three stars\n(30%). The other three rating categories (two, four and five stars) make up less than one percent of\nthe total number of assets on the portal. Typically, one-star assets are in more static file formats\nsuch as PDFs. Three-star assets are files that can be opened without proprietary software, such as\nany program in the Microsoft Suite. These assets tend to be in the comma separated lists (CSVs)\nformat, which provides many benefits including greater accessibility and ease of updating/data\nmanipulation. Departments should review older assets to determine whether appropriate updates\ncan be made to boost their openness rating.\nShoot for the openness stars: Assess your open data and information assets\nagainst the criteria, costs, and benefits of the openness rating system to make\nappropriate updates that can get them to 5 stars.\n2.8.2. Retention\nPer the Library and Archives Act, Library and Archives Canada (LAC) “facilitates the management of\ninformation by government institutions” (subsection 7(d)) and “advises government institutions\n37\nconcerning the management of information produced or used by them and provides services for\nthat purpose” (subsection 8(g)). Under section 12 of the Act, LAC is empowered to provide the sole\nauthorization to government departments for disposition of government records. The Act defines\nrecords as “any documentary material other than a publication, regardless of medium or form.”\nThe Open Government Portal is a platform, accessible by all departments, that enables publication\nto GC records. TBS does not take ownership of the records, nor assume responsibility for their\nmanagement. As such, within the context of retention, records on the Open Government Portal are\nconsidered as a consultation copy of the records that are managed in a corporate\nrepository/system.\nOpen government falls under TBS’s Administrative Leadership Program, with the goal to “lead\ngovernment-wide initiatives; develop policies and set the strategic direction for government\nadministration related to service delivery and access to government information, as well as the\nmanagement of assets, finances, information and technology.” As such, TBS is responsible for\nsetting guidance for the management of data and information released on the Open Government\nPortal.\nIn the spirit of open government, data and information remain on open.canada.ca indefinitely.\nHowever, departments remain responsible for the maintenance of the official information and data\nassets within their corporate repositories and systems in accordance with their internal IM policies,\nand can dispose of them only in accordance with the disposition authorizations issued by LAC, per\nLibrary and Archives Act, section 12.\nExceptions apply to the indefinite access of data and information on the Open Government Portal,\nwhere specified retention periods are in place or when new retention periods are established; for\nexample, in Appendix D of the Directive on Proactive Publication under the Access to Information\nAct. This approach supports the realization of Canada’s Digital Ambition, where departments\n“prioritize the release of high-quality and demanded open data and information to allow the public\nto generate their own economic and social value.” As researchers, businesses, other government\njurisdictions and members of the public reuse open government data to innovate and solve\nproblems, information and data assets may be integrated for different purposes than they were\noriginally created. With this in mind, retention guidance seeks to maximize the life cycle of open\nassets to in turn maximize the potential for public value.\nFor more information on retention guidance for the Open Government Portal, contact the TBS\nOpen Government Team at open-ouvert@tbs-sct.ca.\n3. Appendix A: Privacy, security and confidentiality guidelines\n3.1. Introduction\nIn advancing open government, GC departments should balance the desire for openness and\ntransparency with respecting privacy, security, confidentiality, and legal considerations associated\nwith the requirements described in this document.\n38\nAn understanding of these requirements is of particular importance when deciding what should be\nreleased as an open data or information asset. It is also important to consider that assets exist along\na data/information spectrum, where they may be open, shared or closed based on their nature. For\nexample, the asset’s contents, size, publisher and intended audience may dictate where it falls along\nthe data spectrum.\nThe purpose of the guidelines in this section is to identify privacy, security, and confidentiality\nrequirements and the relevant guidance to departments and agencies releasing open data and\ninformation. It is predicated on the understanding that departments and agencies should not\nrelease protected, classified, or personal information to support open government.\n3.2. Principles\nApart from guidance provided related to protected, classified, or personal information, each\ndepartment and agency’s operational context varies and these principles are not strictly prescriptive\nin nature. Constantly evolving technology renders prescriptive guidance at risk of becoming quickly\noutdated. As such, departments should adapt and apply the following principles as appropriate.\n3.2.1. Information categorization\nAs the originator of a record, each department is responsible for a plan, the implementation of\ninformation categorization systems and the review of data and information prior to release on\nthe Open Government Portal.\na) If it is third party information (government-to-government, government-to-industry, other),\nadditional release mechanisms are up to department review\nb) Training and awareness on the requirements of the Portal are needed to reduce additional\nwork for other departmental stakeholders such as ATI or Privacy officers\nc) Departments are also responsible for reviewing the metadata and telemetry of datasets to\nreduce the risk that combining smaller pieces of the data could enable a malicious user to\naction one of the risk scenarios\n3.2.2. Legal and policy framework\nDepartments must continue to observe all applicable domestic and international laws as they\nrelate to handling assets and should be respectful when considering which assets are being\nshared and released on the Portal.\n3.2.3. Respect for privacy and persons\nDepartments must protect personal information by not releasing it on the Portal.\na) Departments must ensure that all data and information released on the Portal contains no\npersonal information and is sufficiently anonymized\nb) Departments should be transparent about how data and information will be collected, used\nand shared on the Portal\nc) Within an open-by-default environment, departments must identify situations and datasets\nthat cannot be released or be made open by design\n39\n3.2.4. Forward planning\nDepartments should consider privacy, security and confidentiality when releasing records on the\nPortal. Considerations should include:\na) consulting internally with business line and data/information owners/stewards and ATIP\noffices to identify any potential risks to the public, the departments and the government as\na whole\nb) the Privacy Implementation Notice to ensure protection of privacy when releasing\ninformation about a small number of individuals\nc) assessing privacy and security on an ongoing basis, as due diligence does not end with\nuploading a record; it is an ongoing responsibility to maintain the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all records\nd) making plans prior to the release of records for their maintenance and periodic reviews of\nthe privacy and security implications of the universe of relevant records available on the\nPortal\ne) assigning clear accountabilities within departments and agencies for considering privacy\nand security implications of open government records\nf) assigning clear and documented accountability for the information and data\n3.2.5. Security and privacy incidents and remediation\nDepartments and agencies will take steps to ensure their ability to respond effectively in the\ncase of a privacy breach or security incident.\na) In the event of any real or suspected security incidents, departments and agencies will\nrespond in accordance with the now archived Directive on Departmental Security\nManagement (DDSM), departmental and agency processes and procedures and, when\napplicable, the Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP).\nb) In the event of any real or suspected privacy breach, departments and agencies will\nrespond in accordance with the Directive on Privacy Practices. Departments and agencies\nshould apprise themselves of the Digital Privacy Playbook and the Privacy Breach\nManagement Toolkit. These privacy instruments identify causes of privacy breaches;\nprovide guidance on how to respond, contain and manage privacy breaches; delineate roles\nand responsibilities; and include links to relevant supporting documentation.\n3.2.6. Anonymization\nWhen sufficiently anonymizing information and data, the following should be considered:\na) Anonymization should be applied only by officials who have been expertly trained in this\narea\nb) Software for anonymization is not always available and may need to be developed\nc) Effective anonymization may reduce the granularity of records and, as a result, data and\ninformation quality may decrease\nd) Anonymization can be costly and require significant investments of resources, time and\ndata processing\ne) Extrapolation or aggregation risks may persist, despite anonymization efforts\n40\n3.3. Security and privacy context\n3.3.1. Threat landscape\nOpen government services are provided through systems like the Open Government Portal that\nare publicly accessible. From a security perspective, these kinds of systems seek to balance\nbroad public access, lowering cost and increasing efficiency against protection of classified\ninformation, privacy rights, and security protection requirements.\nAs a result, the security controls implemented in the Open Government Portal systems are\ndesigned to mitigate threats from diverse threat actors (e.g., hacktivists, organized crime,\nforeign intelligence) to protect privacy rights as well as the integrity and availability of classified\ninformation. Departments and agencies need to evaluate injury that could be reasonably\nexpected from threat actors on a case-by-case basis as well as in the aggregate before\npublishing open government information.\n3.3.2. Security and privacy risk statements\nOpen government, specifically maximizing the release of GC information assets, may pose the\nfollowing security and privacy risks:\n1. Sensitive GC information (including personal information and data) is disclosed to the public\n2. Information or data that is not owned by the GC or by the department(s) using it is disclosed\nto the public\n3. Integrity of the information or data is compromised by modifying or corrupting the records\n4. Personal information and data about Canadians disclosed by the GC has not been\nsufficiently anonymized leading to re-identification and a privacy breach\n5. Information or data in the open government environment is combined from multiple\nsources that collectively may reveal protected or classified GC information (personal or third\nparty) and could also reveal discrepancies between GC information/data and other sources\n3.3.3. Security and privacy risk scenarios\nThe following are real examples or hypothetical scenarios for the risks listed above.\ni. Disclosure of sensitive information or data\nReference from ComputerWorld article, “Open Government Could Lead to Data Leak”: In 2009,\na document was accidently posted on “the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) Web site that\nlisted all U.S. civilian nuclear sites along with descriptions of their assets and activities. The 267-\npage document was part of a federal government report being prepared for the United Nations’\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The document had been categorized as ‘sensitive\nbut unclassified’ – or SBU – a [U.S.] government designation that usually includes at least some\ncontrols over disclosure. A large number of [U.S.] government documents fall under the SBU\ncategory.”1\n1 Vijayan, J. (2009, June 15). Open Government Could Lead to Data Leaks. Retrieved from ComputerWorld:\nhttp://www.computerworld.com/article/2551066/security0/open-government-could-lead-to-data-leaks.html\n41\nii. Disclosure of personal information\nReference from TechCrunch article, “AOL Proudly Releases Massive Amounts of Private Data”: A\ncommonly cited example occurred when America Online (AOL) released “anonymized” search\nresults from 650,000 of its users. This turned out to be a case of very weak anonymization, since\nAOL failed to consider the fact that individuals often perform web searches for their own names,\nallowing interested individuals to significantly narrow the list of potential names right off the\nbat.2\niii.

Aggregation of data\nReference from Neustar Research article “Riding with the Stars: Passenger Privacy in the NYC\nTaxicab Dataset”: “In 2014 the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission released 173\nmillion records of taxi trips from the previous year including details about every taxi ride (yellow\ncabs) in New York from 2013, including the pickup and drop off times, locations, fare and tip\namounts, as well as using cryptographic hashing to de-identify the taxi’s license and medallion\nnumbers. Researchers were able to crack the code, and subsequently this dataset in\ncombination with a small amount of additional information was demonstrated to reveal\npersonal information not previously released to the public.

Appendix B: Governance\n4.1. Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to provide high-level guidelines on implementing, improving and\nmaintaining departmental governance and reporting frameworks to support open government\ninitiatives, activities and reporting requirements. This section provides recommendations on what a\ngovernance structure for open government could look like. It is important to note that these are\nrecommendations and suggestions. It is not expected that all GC departments will structure\nthemselves based on these guidelines, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach for implementing\nopen government.\n4.2. Overview\nThe overall intent is to ensure that the scope of all roles and responsibilities that enable the\ncontinual release of eligible data and information are clearly defined, and that recommended\ngovernance structures and practices are shared, deployed and understood within all departments\nand agencies subject to the Directive on Open Government. Good governance in open government\npractices will allow departments to be more transparent, open and timely in providing Canadians\naccess to government data and information. In turn, this will provide Canadians with increasing\nopportunities for innovation and economic growth and build greater trust in the GC.\nGood governance in the open government space will provide the necessary structure to ensure that:\n• open data and information are released in a timely fashion\n• after consideration of privacy, security, and confidentiality requirements, high-value priority\ndata and information are released first\n• departments and agencies fully and competently comply with all release criteria\n• approval processes are well understood and operate with efficiency\n• all necessary resources are in place to support efficient operations\n• planning and reporting are transparent and timely\n• departments and agencies act as one cohesive unit\n• required tools and training are provided\n• support for culture change, open communications and problem resolution are in place\n4.3. Audience\nThe intended audience for this information is those in key leadership roles to support open\ngovernment within their department or agency, such as:\n• chief information/data/security officer and staff\n• IM/IT managers\n• open government coordinators\n• data custodians, stewards and managers\n• researchers and scientists\n• business owners\n• ATIP offices\n• others with a role in data and information management and dissemination\n46\n4.4. Risks\nThe following list outlines potential risks of not establishing governance roles and responsibilities to\neffectively support open government:\n• Lack of engagement across the organization\n• Inadequate support on behalf of data owners, stewards and custodians\n• Inadequate education and awareness across the organization\n• Improper release of data and information / privacy breaches\n• Unlawful collection/disclosure (sharing) of data\n• Challenges meeting publication deadlines, specifically for publications requiring department-\nwide collaboration (e.g., packages of briefing material prepared for new or incoming ministers)\n• Failure to achieve compliance and deliverables as mandated by the Directive on Open\nGovernment\n4.5. Best practices\nThe OECD defines open government as a “a culture of governance.” To foster this open government\nculture and balance it with the ease of releasing open assets, leading departments across the GC\nhave highlighted the following best practices.\nOpen government Executive champions Reporting through Building internal\ncoordinato rs Departments that have executive committees governance\nAssign a de dicated open identified an executive Departments should Departments with their\ngovernmen t coordinator to open government recognize open own internal working\nrepresent y our champion tend to get more government initiatives as groups dedicated to\norganizatio n, who actively buy-in on key open an opportunity to drive open government tend\nparticipates in internal and government initiatives. better collaboration.

Roles and responsibilities\nTo successfully release government data and information, departmental stakeholders with key roles\nand responsibilities should be identified. In some cases, these new roles and responsibilities may\nsimply be an addition to existing governance structures and terms of reference. It is critical that the\nappropriate stakeholders are engaged throughout the approval and release process.\nIn alignment with the Directive on Open on Government, departmental stakeholders are responsible\nfor the following.\nDepartmental release process\n• Establish a process to release departmental data and information assets to the open\ngovernment portal\n• Review potential assets for privacy, security, confidentiality, and other legal requirements\n• Designate the appropriate level of approvals for release\n• Ensure adequate prioritization, accuracy and timely release of data and information assets\nOpen and strategic management of assets\n• Implement open-by-design principles in services, programs, and systems\n• Ensure the eligibility for release as an open asset\n• Support the development of releasable versions of assets deemed ineligible for release due\nto privacy, security and/or confidentiality\n• Ensure the quality and completeness of assets in accordance with metadata requirements\n• Ensure the retention of open assets on the open government portal for the maximum\namount of time possible based on considerations for their public value and demand\n• Develop and update an inventory of high-value data and information\nPlanning and reporting\n• Ensure open government considerations are included in departmental plans\nGovernance\n• Designate officials and coordinators responsible for implementing departmental open\ngovernment functions\n• Participate in TBS-led open government governance committees\n• Ensure data and information are interoperable, compatible and complementary across the\nGC enterprise\nEngagement\n• Support engagement with stakeholders for the development of the departmental open\ngovernment programs\n48\nBelow are examples of

Governance body (example)\nOpen government is a significant cultural change for most departments and agencies. This change\ncan be successful only with active participation and the sharing of roles and responsibilities across\nthe organization at all levels. The following diagram is a simplified example of a governance model\nthat supports open government.\n52\nFigure 8: Governance model to support open government\nThis simplified example introduces three new bodies for the specific purpose of enabling effective\nopen government decision-making and guidance (in many departments, these bodies may already\nexist as part of data or information management governance).\n4.7.1.

Vocabularies play a very important role in\nlinked data, specifically to help with data integration. The\nGC’s Open Government Portal uses vocabularies to help\ndescribe data and information and enable more efficient\ns earching of Canada’s open data and open information.\n22 W3C Data on the Web\n75', 'file_name': 'Open Government Guidebook 2023', 'metadata': {'source': 'GoC', 'year': 2023}}
