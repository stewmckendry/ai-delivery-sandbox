# Reverse Engineering Summary: GovDoc Copilot ‚Äî Iteration 5

**Date:** 2025-06-10

---

## üß† Chain of Thought (Research Strategy and Steps)

1. **Prompt Scoping:** Began with detailed analysis of the final Iteration 5 prompt to determine primary objectives and focus areas.
2. **File Prioritization:** Used the user‚Äôs priority list to target files in:
   - `app/engines/toolchains/`
   - `app/tools/tool_wrappers/`
   - `app/engines/api_router.py`, `main.py`
   - `openapi.json`
   - `project/reference/tool_catalog.yaml`
   - `project/reference/gate_reference_v2.yaml`
3. **User Flow Alignment:** Cross-referenced the user-facing flow from `policygpt_custom_gpt_guide.md` against actual toolchains and tool wrappers to ensure implementation matches design intent.
4. **Runtime Trace Verification:** Reviewed `log_tool_usage.json` to validate which tools and chains are actually invoked, filtering out unused paths.
5. **Tool Mapping:** Used `tool_catalog.yaml` to validate module-to-tool mappings and ensure file paths matched up with expected implementations.
6. **Documentation Synthesis:** Created structured analysis by capability area: ingestion, alignment, research, generation, orchestration, and finalization.

| - `tool_wrappers/*.py`          | 7+ core tool wrappers referenced in catalog        |
| - `toolchains/*.py`             | 3+ used by generate_section_chain and input ingest |
| - `api_router.py`, `main.py`    | Inspected for orchestration and route logic        |
| - YAML/JSON files                | 3 (tool_catalog.yaml, gate_reference_v2.yaml, openapi.json) |
| Markdown specs (as context)     | 1 (policygpt_custom_gpt_guide.md)                  |
| Total relevant repo files       | Estimated 80‚Äì100 (based on standard app layout)    |
| Skipped files                   | 60‚Äì70+                                             |
| Why skipped                     | Unused legacy memory models (`memory_*.py`), Redis utilities, scripts folder, or files with no usage trace or catalog entry |

## ‚ùì Open Questions + Assumptions

1. **Toolchain Definitions:** Some toolchains like `generate_section_chain` are referenced but not fully defined in visible code. Assumed structure based on naming patterns and prior versions (e.g., ComposeAndCiteChain).
2. **Reference Alignment:** Assumed `alignWithReferenceDocuments` uses vector embeddings based on its description, though embedding method/backend not visible in repo subset.
3. **Section Review Logic:** Tools like `revise_section_chain` are noted but the internal versioning or draft diffing process is not explicitly available.
4. **Prompt Templates:** `app/prompts/` was not included in the scan; assumed correct prompt use based on schema names like `section_synthesizer`.
5. **OpenAPI schema linkage:** The `openapi.json` file was described but not uploaded‚Äîassumed schema matches tool metadata from `tool_catalog.yaml`.

Would benefit from validation on:
- Active vector DB implementation (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS, Redis+Vector)
- Whether ComposeAndCiteChain is current name or replaced
- Final LLM prompt formatting logic if not in `section_synthesizer.py`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and Suggested Prompt Improvements

### Challenges Faced
- **Partial visibility into toolchain orchestration:** Orchestration patterns (e.g., planner logic, class-to-endpoint mapping) were inferred but not fully codified.
- **Ambiguity around memory architecture:** Terms like "PromptLog", "Redis", "session memory" are referenced without concrete schema or data model examples.
- **Undocumented flows:** Some documented flows (e.g., review cycle and diffing) are implied but not backed by clearly named classes.
- **Missing file context:** `openapi.json` and key toolchain implementations (e.g., `generate_section_chain.py`) not fully loaded or inspectable.

### What Would've Helped in the Prompt
- Clarify which embedding backend is used and where (Pinecone? FAISS? Redis?)
- Mention whether the orchestrator logic (Planner class) exists or is distributed
- Explicit note on whether `section_synthesizer`, `section_refiner`, etc. are actual files or logical steps inside LLM prompts
- Explicitly include or reference the `app/prompts/` directory to trace prompt logic
