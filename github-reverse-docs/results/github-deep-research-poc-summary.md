# 🔍 PoC Summary: Using ChatGPT + GitHub Data Connector to Reverse Engineer Legacy Systems

## 🧭 Objective
Demonstrate the feasibility and value of using ChatGPT’s Deep Research with the GitHub data connector to:
- Extract actionable documentation from legacy code
- Generate user stories, system design artifacts, test outlines, and modernization suggestions
- Evaluate scalability for large enterprise systems

## ✅ Key Findings

### ✔️ What Worked Well
- **Deep Understanding of Code Paths**: When guided by entry points (`main.py`, `openapi.json`), GPT effectively traced orchestration logic, chains, and tools.
- **Accurate Documentation Generation**: Generated high-quality user stories, API schemas, design decompositions, and modernization ideas.
- **Effective Prompt Tuning**: Iterative refinements (e.g., exclude legacy folders, prioritize runtime artifacts) significantly improved results.
- **Cross-Referencing Artifacts**: GPT effectively inferred logic even across files (e.g., linking routes to tools via planner/registry).

### 🚫 What Didn’t Work
- **Codebase Size Limits**: GPT scanned ~60–70% of files before truncating. This may miss important modules in large repos.
- **Ambiguity in Runtime State**: GPT couldn’t distinguish between implemented, stubbed, and deprecated components without usage clues.
- **Dynamic Prompt/Config Load**: Templates and chains pulled dynamically (e.g., from GitHub) are difficult to resolve statically.
- **Legacy Noise**: Without scoped prompts, GPT pulled in irrelevant modules (e.g., from unrelated framework areas).

## 🛠️ Recommendations

### Prompt Engineering
- Always specify:
  - **Primary entry points** (e.g., `main.py`, `openapi.json`)
  - **Folders to prioritize** (e.g., chains, tools, api)
  - **Folders to ignore** (e.g., scripts, legacy, framework)
- Include **business context** (e.g., from blog posts, specs) to guide GPT’s assumptions

### Codebase Readiness
- Consider generating:
  - A `flow_manifest.yaml` mapping tools → chains → endpoints
  - Snapshots of runtime templates (for prompt loading)
  - Logs of chain/tool invocation to prioritize active paths

### Execution Strategy
- For large codebases, use a **chunked prompt strategy**:
  - Slice repo by domain or entry point
  - Analyze each chunk independently
  - Assemble final doc via meta-synthesis

## 🧩 When to Use This
- **Legacy Replatforming**: Understand undocumented systems to replicate behavior or modularize
- **QA & Test Planning**: Generate test outlines from user flows
- **Audit Prep**: Reconstruct how a system processes data, makes decisions
- **Design Docs**: Produce missing technical and interface designs
- **Onboarding**: Help new devs grasp system structure via diagrams/stories

## 🌐 Broader Enterprise Use Cases
- **Security Reviews**: Flag high-risk flows or lack of input validation
- **Compliance Checks**: Trace logic relevant to GDPR, PIPEDA, etc.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Track which modules/tools depend on others
- **Automated Doc Sync**: Regenerate design/user doc after major releases

## 📉 Limitations of Current GPT + GitHub Connector
| Limitation | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| File Scan Cap | Scans ~150–180 files before truncating |
| No Code Execution | Can’t run/test code to verify logic or config |
| Dynamic Imports | Hard to resolve remote-fetched templates/configs |
| Ambiguous State | No visibility into runtime tool usage or active flags |

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- **Multi-pass scanning across repo slices**
- **Toolchain observability: logs + heatmaps**
- **Prompt-template cache or visual flow maps**
- **Enterprise memory for artifact evolution**

## ✅ Verdict
ChatGPT + GitHub connector is a powerful **first-pass reverse engineering tool**, especially when paired with precise prompts and runtime insights. While not fully autonomous, it can accelerate understanding and documentation dramatically — ideal for audit, migration, onboarding, or legacy refactoring contexts.
