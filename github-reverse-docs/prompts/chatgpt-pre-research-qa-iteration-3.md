# ðŸ¤– ChatGPT Pre-Research Q&A â€“ Iteration 3

## GPT Questions
> Before I begin reverse-engineering the ai-delivery-sandbox repository, could you confirm if there's a specific feature flow or use case you'd like me to prioritize (e.g., Business Case drafting, Web research integration, Memory handoff)? Also, do you want me to include any artifact samples (e.g., OpenAPI schema snippets, class diagrams, etc.) in the deliverable?

## Response
> Please prioritize the feature flow for **Business Case drafting** as the main use case. This flow likely involves web research, prompt templating, document assembly, and tool orchestration.
>
> Also, feel free to include artifact samples like:
> - **OpenAPI schema snippets** (for tool invocation structure)
> - **Class or sequence diagrams** (to visualize toolchain flow or component interactions)
> - **Example prompts or input/output flows**, if clearly defined
>
> Keep in mind: treat visualizations as illustrative aids â€” accuracy is more important than polish.
