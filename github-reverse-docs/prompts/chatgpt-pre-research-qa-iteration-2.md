# ðŸ¤– ChatGPT Pre-Research Q&A â€“ Iteration 2

## GPT Questions
1. Are there any specific folders or modules you want prioritized (e.g., api, tools, chains, etc.)?
2. Should I assume that all active features of GovDoc Copilot are hosted in this repo, or do they depend on external services/codebases as well?
3. Should the outputs include proposed implementation strategies (e.g., for reimplementation in another framework/language), or just diagnostics and artifact extraction?

## Response
1. Please prioritize the following key folders: `toolchains`, `tool_wrappers`, `prompts`, `db`, and `redis`. Key top-level files to start from or reference include: `openapi.json`, `main.py`, `api_router.py`, `tool_registry.py`, `planner_orchestrator.py`, `memory_sync.py`, `tool_catalog.yaml`, and `gate_reference_v2.yaml`.

2. Assume all active functionality for GovDoc Copilot is hosted in this repo. If you detect stubs or placeholders for external services, note them, but donâ€™t explore beyond this codebase.

3. Focus on diagnostics and artifact extraction (user stories, design decomposition, test outline, modernization). Implementation strategies are not required in this iteration.
