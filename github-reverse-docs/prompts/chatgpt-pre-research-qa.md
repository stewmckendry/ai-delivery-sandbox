## Q&A Before Deep Research Launch

**ChatGPT Question:**
> To move forward with analyzing the `ai-delivery-sandbox` repo on the `sandbox-curious-falcon` branch, could you please confirm whether there are specific folders or files you'd like prioritized during the scan, or should I apply the full strategy outlined (focus on complete/recent components and ignore placeholders/dead code)?

**User Response:**
> Please apply the full strategy outlined in the prompt:
> - Prioritize complete or recently modified components
> - Ignore obviously dead code, placeholders, or very outdated files
>
> You may scan the full repo and decide what to focus on based on those principles.
>
> If you find multiple potential entry points, feel free to list them and choose the most active/logical one to analyze in depth.
