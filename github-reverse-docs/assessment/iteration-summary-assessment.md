### 📈 Overall Progress

- Iteration 1 established the basic format but lacked precision.
- Iteration 2 improved capability mapping and started interpreting the openapi schema and Redis flows.
- Iteration 3 added runtime usage alignment and accurate memory analysis, though still missed some orchestration structure.
- Iteration 4 delivered the best synthesis: precise user flow mapping, inline code references, and a solid architectural view.

### ⚠️ System Limitations Observed

1. **Scaling Ceiling** — ChatGPT with Deep Research capped out around 80–100 files per run, which could pose problems for monoliths.
2. **Shallow Test Insight** — Even with access to `test_*.py`, Deep Research didn’t synthesize concrete test flows.
3. **Prompt Template Interpretation** — YAML and inline prompts were processed structurally, not semantically.
4. **Memory and Usage Ambiguity** — Required runtime logs and external signals to distinguish between active and deprecated logic.

### 💡 Recommendations for Effective Reverse Engineering

1. **Use Runtime Logs**: Provide call logs to distinguish active from inactive paths.
2. **Include Prompt Libraries**: Clarify paths to templates and prompt formats.
3. **Define User Flow Anchors**: Enable the model to orient around real user workflows.
4. **Chunk and Parallelize**: For large systems, break the repo into segments and reassemble artifacts.

### 🚀 Potential Use Cases Beyond Reverse Engineering

- **Test Coverage Tracing** — Identify where system lacks automated coverage
- **Onboarding Maps** — Create dev-friendly overviews of system components and flows
- **Component Dependency Graphs** — Understand system coupling and migration complexity
- **Microservice Isolation Guides** — Spot candidates for refactor or decomposition

This PoC demonstrated that ChatGPT + GitHub connector, enhanced with targeted runtime logs and user flow maps, can meaningfully reverse-engineer moderately complex systems. While some details (tests, orchestration paths) still require human judgment, the foundational analysis is viable and valuable for legacy system modernization.
