ðŸš¨ Can AI help us understand legacy systems faster?

We just ran a new experimentâ€”this time not on a greenfield AI app, but on a real-world legacy system.

ðŸ§  What we tested:
OpenAI recently released two major features in ChatGPT:

Deep Research, which connects to your GitHub repo and summarizes code + documents
Codex Agent, which reads your codebase and proposes real working changes
ðŸ’¡ So we asked:
Could these new tools help reverse engineer a legacy codebaseâ€”one with 150+ files, limited documentation, and no prior context?

âœ… What we found:
These agents can generate:

User stories grounded in code logic
Architectural insights
Test plans + modernization suggestions
Even pull requests that fix or improve the system
ðŸ“ˆ For any team planning to replace, refactor, or onboard to a legacy system, this points to something exciting:

AI may now help us understand before we buildâ€”reducing risk and accelerating modernization.

Unlike most AI coding tools, this wasn't just about generating lines of code. It was about using AI to understand the system itselfâ€”structure, logic, gaps, and all.
