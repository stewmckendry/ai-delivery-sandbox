# 🧪 Deep Research Output Evaluation – Iteration 1

## ✅ Strengths

### 1. **Strong Functional Comprehension**
- Accurately identified the overall purpose and structure of the GovDoc Copilot.
- Captured the general workflow (e.g., input ingestion → chain processing → artifact generation).
- Clear, structured documentation of user stories, design elements, and test plan.

### 2. **Effective Design Decomposition**
- Separated technical, interface, and data designs as requested.
- Highlighted the use of chains, tools, FastAPI routes, and model structure.

### 3. **Sound Modernization Suggestions**
- Called out modularization opportunities, documentation gaps, and legacy cleanup needs.

## ⚠️ Gaps / Limitations

### 1. **False Association with Other Apps**
- Referenced a concussion triage app not relevant to this repo. This may be due to leftover or copied files creating naming noise.

### 2. **Missed Key Functional Features**
- Did not reference the vector DB, embedding-based search, or external reference document alignment – core to artifact generation logic.
- Omitted discussion of web research, citation logging, and prompt chaining in UI flows.

### 3. **Traversal Prioritization Misstep**
- Lacked a clear grounding in the OpenAPI schema as a definitive starting point.
- Should have prioritized `src/server/routes` + `main.py` for top-down clarity on entry points.

### 4. **Scale/Timeout Limitations**
- Analyzed only 36 of ~171 files.
- Appears to time out or apply a file-count cap, which limits completeness in larger repos.

## 📈 Opportunities for Improvement

### 📌 Prompt Refinement
- Add instruction to start from OpenAPI schema or entrypoint route definitions.
- Emphasize: derive truth from active code paths, use docs for context only.
- Call out vector DB and web search as critical systems to identify if present.

### 📌 Methodological Shift
- Consider chunking strategy: analyze high-value folders in segments.
- Chain separate Deep Research runs, then assemble into master artifact.

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Refine the prompt with OpenAPI-first + vector DB + web search focus.
2. Prepare for a modular run strategy if needed (multiple research passes).
3. Re-run and compare outputs with Iteration 1.
