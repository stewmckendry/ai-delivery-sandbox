# ðŸ“š Reverse Engineering Research Summary: `ai-delivery-sandbox` (`sandbox-curious-falcon`)

## ðŸ§  Chain of Thought & Research Strategy

To reverse-engineer the `ai-delivery-sandbox` repository and extract artifacts useful for system understanding, migration, and reimplementation, I followed this top-down approach:

1. **Starting Point:** Began with `main.py`, `api_router.py`, and `openapi.json` to identify available routes, API structure, and entry points to the app.
2. **Tool & Chain Analysis:** Traced route handlers to the `PlannerOrchestrator`, then into prioritized toolchains (`toolchains/`) and their associated tool wrappers (`tool_wrappers/`), confirming the orchestration logic and atomic tool behavior.
3. **Prompt Usage:** Examined `prompts/` folder for examples of externalized LLM logic (YAML-based prompts), their loading mechanism, and dynamic rendering behavior.
4. **Data & Storage:** Analyzed `db/` (SQLAlchemy models and DB logic) and `redis/` (assumed future intent of caching/session handling) for system persistence and memory design.
5. **Cross-reference:** Verified usage patterns and assumptions using work package notes and in-code docstrings, confirming design intents and mismatches.

All findings were synthesized into four outputs: User Stories, Design Decomposition, Test Suite Outline, and Modernization Opportunities.

## ðŸš§ Research Challenges & Suggestions

### Challenges Faced
- **Mixed Code States:** Many files were in partial or deprecated states (e.g., early Redis stubs, non-functional wrappers), which required active filtering to avoid misleading assumptions.
- **Manual Mapping of Chains:** The lack of an explicit toolchain registry (only implicit in PlannerOrchestrator) made it time-consuming to identify all valid toolchains and their tool sequences.
- **Prompt Templates as GitHub Links:** Dynamic loading of prompts via raw GitHub URLs made static analysis brittle. Some required assumptions on what the prompt text would contain.
- **Sparse Inline Docs:** While some docstrings existed, most orchestration logic and API endpoint rationale had to be inferred from code flow or test artifacts.

### Prompt Additions That Would Have Helped
- A list of *active vs deprecated chains/tools* from recent usage
- An explicit prompt to ignore legacy `scripts/`, `docs/`, and early `redis/` prototypes unless directly referenced
- A note on whether prompt templates should be resolved via GitHub links or assumed present locally (for validation)
- Clear guidance on whether ReasoningTrace was YAML-based or DB-persisted for analysis

âœ… **Next Steps Suggested:** Maintain a toolchain index, refactor Planner to declaratively register toolchains, and streamline prompt template access to avoid dynamic fetches from external URLs during execution or inspection.
