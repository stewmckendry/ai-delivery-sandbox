# üß† Research Chain of Thought & File Review Summary

## 1. Research Strategy

### Objective Framing
- Goal: Extract current functionality from a legacy-style repo to support migration or reimplementation.
- Scope: Focus on complete, active, or recently updated code. Ignore dead code, placeholders, or outdated files.

### Entry Point Identification
- Scanned root, `project/`, and `src/` for orchestration logic and toolchain classes.
- Prioritized `toolchains/`, `tools/`, `models/`, `utils/`, and test scripts.
- Reviewed markdown and YAML docs for context.

### Chain and Tool Traversal
- Identified major chains (e.g. `GenerateSectionChain`, `IngestInputChain`) and mapped their tool calls.
- Traced tools (`run_tool()` methods), logging points, and LLM/DB interactions.
- Documented dependencies, inputs/outputs, and schema usage.

### Data and Prompt Handling
- Reconstructed SQLAlchemy model schemas.
- Mapped data transformations and flow between steps (e.g. profile ‚Üí prompt ‚Üí section ‚Üí artifact).
- Reviewed prompt templates, logging, and memory systems.

### Test Extraction and Validation
- Parsed `project/test/` scripts to extract functional behaviors and edge cases.
- Aligned test flows with chain/tool logic for a test strategy.

### Synthesis
- Consolidated findings into the 4 requested outputs: user stories, design, test plan, modernization roadmap.
