# 🧠 Research Summary – Reverse Engineering GovDoc Copilot

## 🔗 Chain of Thought: Research Strategy

The goal was to reverse engineer the `sandbox-curious-falcon` branch of the `ai-delivery-sandbox` repo to trace how GovDoc Copilot works in practice. The strategy followed a layered approach:

1. **Understand Intended Flow**  
   - Start with `policygpt_user_flow.md` to understand the high-level user journey and expected tool invocations.
   - Break the journey into 6 capability areas as defined in the prompt.

2. **Map Declared to Actual Implementation**  
   - Parse `tool_catalog.yaml` to map GPT-exposed tools to internal Python modules and classes.
   - Use this mapping to identify where in the repo functionality for each capability resides.

3. **Trace Runtime Usage**  
   - Load and analyze `log_tool_usage.json` to verify which tools are invoked in real-world use.
   - Use timestamps and summaries to infer the sequence and behavior of toolchains.

4. **Deep Dive per Capability**  
   - For each capability (e.g. section drafting), identify the chain structure and individual tools.
   - Review logic in `app/engines/toolchains/` and `app/tools/tool_wrappers/`.

5. **Synthesize**  
   - Compile user stories, technical structure, interface logic, test outlines, and modernization opportunities.
   - Include inline file references to support each finding.

## ❓ Open Questions & Assumptions

These were areas where assumptions were made due to lack of clarity or verification sources:

- **Embedding Search:** Assumed future intent to use a vector DB for semantic reference alignment since no embedding logic was visible.
- **Section Storage:** Assumed use of Redis or in-memory structures to hold intermediate section states, since no persistent ArtifactSection model was observed in code.
- **Tool Orchestration:** Assumed planner is partially implemented, not fully dynamic; inferred orchestration from logs and filenames.
- **Version Logs:** The document finalization implies Drive upload and version logging, but logging details are not fully visible.

## ⚠️ Research Challenges

### 1. **Code/Behavior Disconnect**
Many tools were referenced in design or log files but partially or not at all implemented in this branch (e.g., `feedback_structurer`, `manualEditSync`, `listReferenceDocuments`).

> What would help: A short README or roadmap in the branch explaining which tools are stubs, MVP, or planned.

---

### 2. **Incomplete Toolchain Wrapping**
Some chains (like `generate_section_chain`) are inferred from log patterns and naming, not from a single orchestrator file.

> What would help: A single `chains.yaml` or `orchestration_map.md` to document how tools are meant to sequence together.

---

### 3. **No Visual Trace of Planner Decisions**
Orchestration appears hard-coded or manual in places. It’s unclear how GPT decides which tools to call.

> What would help: A reasoning trace or planner debug log to show tool decision rationale per user input.

---

### 4. **Sparse Error Handling Logic**
No clear fallback or retry logic seen in tools, so assumptions made about user-facing experience when tools fail.

> What would help: Log samples or test outputs showing how errors are handled (e.g. file too large, failed Drive upload).

This summary reflects the actual research path and limitations encountered in the reverse engineering of the active branch.
