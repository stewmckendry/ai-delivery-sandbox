Title: How a Custom Concussion GPT Agent Could Transform Youth Sports Safety in Ontario

Each year, thousands of young athletes in Ontario face a hidden threat on the field, rink, or court: concussions. These brain injuries are often underreported, misunderstood, and mismanaged—not due to a lack of concern, but due to a lack of accessible, consistent tools and support.

In Ontario — where Rowan’s Law has made concussion awareness and return-to-play protocols a legal obligation — there’s still a major gap in real-time, accessible concussion support. That’s where a new AI-powered assistant could make a meaningful difference.

🧠 Meet the Concussion Recovery GPT
We’ve built a prototype of a custom ChatGPT agent designed specifically to support concussion management in youth sports. This tool isn’t just a chatbot — it’s an intelligent, structured digital assistant that guides parents, coaches, and players through symptom checking, recovery tracking, and safe return-to-sport protocols based on medical standards like SCAT6.

What it does:
- Helps assess potential concussions through guided Q&A
- Logs symptoms and recovery progress day by day
- Provides stage-specific return-to-play advice
- Shares structured reports with healthcare professionals
- Offers anonymized insights to sports organizations

“This isn’t just another form or chatbot. It’s a smart assistant that helps the right people take the right actions — at the right time.”

🏒 Why This Matters
Too often, concussion incidents go underreported or mismanaged — not out of neglect, but because the system is fragmented. A parent isn’t sure what symptoms matter. A coach doesn’t know the protocol. A doctor sees the patient too late. A sport association never gets the data.

This agent addresses all those pain points by connecting the dots:
- For parents and coaches: Plain-language triage, real-time tracking, and peace of mind
- For physicians: Accurate symptom histories and stage tracking — before the appointment
- For sport associations: Data-driven dashboards that support compliance with Rowan’s Law

️💠 What’s Under the Hood
The system is built on a robust architecture that includes:
- A Custom GPT frontend that handles the conversation and guidance
- A FastAPI backend that applies medical logic and stores structured data
- Integration with Apple HealthKit (mocked) for activity-based recovery tracking
- A FHIR-compatible export that sends structured reports to clinician systems like Epic
- A Power BI dashboard hosted on Azure to visualize concussion trends at scale

And everything is grounded in medical best practices. Our backend encodes the SCAT6 return-to-play stages, symptom thresholds, and triage flows in a structured knowledge graph, enabling consistency and transparency in the guidance provided.

📅 What It Looks Like in Action
- A coach notices a collision on the field → GPT guides the assessment → logs the incident and starts recovery tracking.
- A parent checks in daily → logs symptoms and activity → system advises when to progress to the next stage.
- A doctor receives a structured timeline before the visit → reviews trends, makes a call on clearance.
- A sport system leader pulls quarterly concussion stats → identifies risks by sport and age group.

All journeys start with a simple prompt:
"Are you logging a new injury or checking in on an existing one?"

🚧 Adoption Barriers We Need to Address
No innovation is without challenges. Key considerations include:
- Privacy & Security: We’re handling sensitive youth health data. All information is anonymized, stored securely on Azure, and shared only with user consent.
- Change Management: Coaches and parents may need support to adopt a digital-first model, especially in community or recreational leagues.
- Equity: Not all families have access to wearable devices or feel confident using AI tools. We’re designing with accessibility in mind.
- Clinical Oversight: The agent is not a diagnostic tool. It’s a support system — and must be positioned as such to avoid misuse or over-reliance.

🏁 What’s Next?
While this version is a proof-of-concept, the path forward is promising:
- Deeper integration with electronic medical records
- Expansion to mobile platforms
- Broader rollout with schools and sport associations
- Future use cases in managing other injuries (like sprains, breaks, or heat illness)

🏆 The Bottom Line
Ontario is already leading in concussion policy with Rowan’s Law. Now we have a chance to lead in practical, tech-enabled solutions too.

An AI-powered concussion GPT agent offers real-time guidance, better care coordination, and rich data for safer sport. With thoughtful implementation, it could become a vital part of how we protect young athletes and support their full recovery.
