## MyChart Terms of Service & AI Tool Use

### MyChart Terms of Service & AI Tool Use

The MyChart Terms of Service do **not** explicitly prohibit using an AI tool (like OpenAI Operator) if:

- **You do not share your credentials** (username/password) with the AI.
- **You remain in control** of the session (e.g., you handle login, MFA, and direct the AI’s actions).

#### 🚫 Prohibited Behavior (Implied)

While “AI” or “bots” aren’t mentioned, the agreement states:

- “You must not share your username and password with anyone.”
- “You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password.”
- “You hereby assume the sole liability for your actions in using the Service…”

#### 🤖 Using AI Operator: Acceptable If…

Your use is likely within the Terms if:

- **You initiate and guide the session.**
- **You personally handle secure steps** (login, CAPTCHA, MFA).
- **The AI only assists after access is granted** and remains under your control.

This avoids credential sharing and does not automate access beyond your direct actions.

#### ⚠️ Grey Areas

There’s no explicit mention of automation, scripting, AI agents, or robotic tools. Usage may raise concerns if:

- The session appears automated.
- The AI acts independently or makes decisions without your review.
- Your access causes unexpected behavior (e.g., high-volume scraping).

#### ✅ Best Practices to Stay Compliant

- **Always keep yourself in the loop.**
- **Avoid unattended automation.**
- **Limit access to read-only tasks** (e.g., fetching lab results, visit summaries).
- **Do not simulate clicks or override front-end logic** unless explicitly permitted.

### LifeLabs Terms of Service & Automation/Bot Use

LifeLabs **explicitly prohibits**:

- Any use of data mining, robots, scraping, or similar methods to collect information from their Direct Services or websites.
- Any automated access to their systems via software, bots, or scripts.
- Actions that overload, disrupt, or damage their services.

**You may _not_:**

- Use a robot or bot to log in, navigate, or pull data.
- Run scripts, scrapers, or automation tools—even with your own credentials.

#### 🧑‍💻 What About AI Assistants?

Even if:

- You don’t share your credentials with the AI,
- You manually handle login and MFA,

If the AI tool programmatically interacts with the portal (e.g., clicks buttons, scrapes data, or simulates navigation), this still violates LifeLabs’ prohibition on automation and bot scraping.

#### ✅ What Is Allowed?

- Personally using your browser or the official app.
- Copying and pasting information for your own manual review.
- Manually guiding the AI (e.g., reading your screen and typing its responses), as long as **no automation** occurs.

#### ⚠️ Bottom Line

LifeLabs’ Terms of Service clearly ban automated methods or bots to access or extract data, even under your own account. Using any AI assistant that automates navigation or data retrieval—even with your own login—is against their rules.

### Strava Terms of Service & Automated Access

#### 🔍 General Terms

- Keep your password confidential and are responsible for all activities under your account.
- Prohibits account sharing; all activity must be “authentic activities undertaken by you.”
- Acceptable Use Policy bars inauthentic manipulation, including data manipulation.

#### 🧠 API Agreement

- Forbids “web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction methods.”
- Prohibits using data to train AI or ML models.
- Access via the API must use official Developer Tools and a registered API token, within rate limits.

#### 🧩 AI Tool Use Interpretation

Even if you don’t share credentials and manually handle login/MFA:

- If an AI tool automates clicking, navigation, or data extraction, this is prohibited automation.
- You may only use the official API (with your own registered token) or manually use their website/app.

#### ✅ Bottom Line

Using an AI bot like OpenAI Operator that programmatically interacts with Strava—clicking, scraping, gathering data—violates their terms, even if you’re the account holder. Permitted access is:

- Manually, as a person.
- Via the official API, following all rules and not using it to train AI.
