# ðŸ“£ Growing Demand for Health Data Access and ChatGPT-Like Support ðŸš€

## Canadians Want Their Health Records

A 2023 Canadian Digital Health Survey found that 4 out of 5 Canadians (80%) want to view their lab results, medication history, or immunization records online. However, fewer than 40% have actually done so, highlighting a significant gap between expectations and reality

Statistics Canada reported that in 2023, just over half (51%) of Canadians aged 15+ accessed electronic health information (such as lab results or vaccine records) in the previous year

Provincial data shows disparities: over 55% of residents in BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario accessed e-health records in the last year, while provinces like Quebec and New Brunswick lag behind at around 41%

**Why this matters:** Canadians are eager for digital access to their health data, but adoption is limited by fragmented systems, poor user experience, and access inequities. This highlights the need for a Personal Health Copilotâ€”a simple, unified way for people to access the information they want.

## Using ChatGPT for Health: A Top App Purpose

A June 2024 Australian survey found that nearly 1 in 10 people (9.9%) have already asked ChatGPT a health question. Common topics include learning about a condition (48%), understanding symptoms (37%), receiving advice on next steps (36%), and decoding medical jargon (35%)

Medical studies suggest that people trust chatbots for low-risk health questions: ChatGPT-generated advice was as trusted as physicians for simple inquiries, though trust decreases with complexity

Specialized trends are emerging: ChatGPT is used for virtual dermatology (skincare advice) and mental health support, with Gen Z among the most active users. Parents, in particular, find AI-generated pediatric advice more trustworthy than expert-written alternatives

## What It Means for the Copilot Strategy

There is clear consumer demand: Canadians want access to their health data and help understanding it. A Personal Health Copilot addresses both needs.

AI-supported health queries are on the riseâ€”ChatGPT is already a top tool for health-related questions.

Trust exists for low-risk advice, but careful interpretation is essential. This supports a key design principle: the copilot should explain, not diagnose.

By combining data access with AI support, the Copilot model addresses two major trends: Canadians' desire to understand their health and their willingness to trust AI as a first-level support tool. This is an opportunity eHealth leaders should not overlook.
