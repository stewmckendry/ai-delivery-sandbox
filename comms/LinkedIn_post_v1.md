**New series: Coaching the Machine – Practical AI in the real world**  
We're starting with youth sports and concussions.

Last week, Jocelyne Verity (health exec + sports mom) and I teamed up to prototype something useful:  
**ConcussionGPT** — an AI assistant that helps parents, coaches, and doctors navigate concussion recovery and return-to-play safely.

It’s not a chatbot. It’s a new kind of form. A new kind of support tool.  
Built in days. Grounded in medical guidance. Wired into a real tech stack.

**Why this might interest you:**  
- You work in **sports, health, or youth safety**  
- You’re curious how to **integrate LLMs with FastAPI, Azure, PowerBI, and structured schemas**  
- You care about **rethinking how we build and deliver apps** — faster, lighter, with AI at the core  
- You’re just exploring AI and looking for **real-world, human-led examples**

We wrote about what we built, how, and why.
