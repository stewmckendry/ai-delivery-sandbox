### üï∞Ô∏è Current vs. New Process Comparison

| Journey | Current State (Without App) | New Process (With AI-Powered App) |
|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **A. Initial Concussion Assessment** | Parent or coach uses guesswork, vague online search, or delays reporting. No structured data captured. | Conversational GPT flow triages symptoms, logs data, and starts recovery tracker immediately. |
| **B. Ongoing Recovery Check-In** | Tracking is inconsistent or manual (e.g., paper logs). No stage-based protocol guidance. | Daily symptom/activity check-ins auto-track recovery stage. System gives stage-specific, evidence-based advice. |
| **C. Clinician Summary** | Doctor sees patient after days/weeks with no history or uses patient‚Äôs vague memory. Data entry is manual. | Doctor receives structured timeline (PDF or FHIR) including symptoms, trends, and activities logged in real-time. |
| **D. Sport System Dashboards** | Sport leaders rely on anecdotal updates or delayed incident reports. No visibility into trends or compliance. | Live dashboard with anonymized data by age, sport, and outcome. Enables safer policy and response planning. |
