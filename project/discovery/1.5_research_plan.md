## Task 1.5 ‚Äì Research Spikes: Plan for Concussion Recovery Knowledge Graph

### üéØ Mission
Develop a medical knowledge graph grounded in clinical standards (e.g., SCAT6, peer-reviewed guidelines) to power structured concussion triage, symptom tracking, and recovery guidance.

---

### ‚úÖ Deliverables
1. **YAML files** defining:
   - `stages.yaml`: Recovery stages (based on SCAT6) with progression rules
   - `symptoms.yaml`: Full symptom list with severity, flags, and care guidance
   - `triage_map.yaml`: Follow-up logic for GPT to guide initial assessment

2. **Markdown summary** that:
   - Describes the knowledge graph and how the app uses it
   - Summarizes what‚Äôs in each YAML file
   - Cites clinical sources like SCAT6 and peer-reviewed guidance

### üî¨ Research Plan

#### Sources
- **SCAT6**: Gold standard for concussion staging and return-to-play
- **CDC HEADS UP**: Youth concussion symptoms and response
- **Peer-reviewed literature**: Systematic reviews on concussion recovery stages, pediatric guidance (e.g., BJSM, AAN, Pediatrics)
- **Previous project drafts**: Audit/upgrade the YAMLs from earlier work

#### Research Questions
- How closely do our stages match SCAT6? Any missing elements?
- Are symptom severities and flags clinically aligned?
- What symptom-question pairings are medically recommended in early triage?

#### Method
- Clinical audit of all draft YAMLs
- Refactor structure for GPT/back-end use
- Normalize naming, severity thresholds, flags
- Align `triage_map.yaml` with `concussion_assessment.yaml`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Schema Enhancements
- Use **ID-based keys** and consistent field structure
- Group symptoms by category (physical, cognitive, etc.)
- Add `onset_timing` and `duration_flag` where relevant
- Make follow-up logic tool- and GPT-friendly

---

### ‚ùìClarifications from ProductPod
1. **Sources**: No specific ones requested ‚Äî SCAT6 + clinical judgment ok ‚úÖ
2. **Grouping**: Symptoms will be category-grouped ‚úÖ
3. **FHIR Intent**: YAMLs won‚Äôt be exported to EHR directly but used for GPT reasoning ‚úÖ

---

### üîÅ Next Steps
- Conduct SCAT6/CDC audit
- Rewrite and normalize all YAML files
- Create Markdown explainer
- Deliver drafts with GitHub links for feedback

_This plan is now committed to the repo for transparency and traceability._
