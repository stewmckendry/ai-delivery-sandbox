# üîé Project Goals: PolicyCopilot Proof-of-Concept

## Vision
PolicyCopilot is a GPT-powered assistant that streamlines the creation of complex government documents like Treasury Board submissions and policy proposals. It empowers public servants to work faster and more effectively by combining structured drafting tools with reusable knowledge, all within a human-led, GPT-assisted workflow.

## Problem It Solves
Public sector teams invest weeks or even months developing submission documents to satisfy governance and approval processes. This work is:
- Time-consuming and heavily manual, often requiring 100‚Äì200 hours of staff effort per document
- Seen as a burdensome, administrative ‚Äúcheck-the-box‚Äù exercise with little perceived value-add
- Rigid in structure but highly repetitive, especially across similar submissions
- Hindered by unclear access to past documents, standards, or policy precedents

This results in delays, resource waste, inconsistent quality, and team burnout ‚Äî all while slowing delivery of public value.

## Value Proposition
By transforming this process with AI assistance, PolicyCopilot:
- Boosts productivity by structuring and accelerating draft creation
- Reduces rework by embedding policy alignment and document standards
- Enhances collaboration through guided inputs and smart revisions
- Increases quality and traceability by exporting consistent, GC-compliant outputs

Potential savings: 60‚Äì75% reduction in drafting time, enabling staff to focus on service improvement and impact.

## PoC Focus ‚Äì Project Gating Process
This PoC will focus on the **Government of Canada‚Äôs Project Gating Process**, per the [Treasury Board Directive on the Management of Projects and Programmes](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology-project-management/project-management/guide-project-gating.html). 

The directive outlines specific gates, artifacts, and decision criteria required to obtain project approvals. PolicyCopilot will act as a co-pilot for public servants, helping them generate these artifacts faster and with higher quality to navigate federal approvals effectively.

## Key PoC Goals
- Generate and commit **large documents** with GPT (20+ pages, $1M+ project-level)
- Integrate with **document management platforms** (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive)
- Wire GPT with **research tools** for evidence-based policy and program development
- Streamline **stakeholder consultations** via AI-assisted transcription and summarization
- Ensure **traceability and transparency** with committed files, chain-of-thought logs, and decision trails
- Add **validation tools** (e.g., required fields, logic model checks) to reduce risk of proposal rejection

## Why GoC Would Care
PolicyCopilot aligns with key Government of Canada priorities:
- Supports digital government and automation
- Reduces costs and improves delivery speed
- Standardizes documentation and audit trails
- Enables better policy and program outcomes through structured, evidence-based inputs

## Broader Applications
Beyond IT gating, this system could support:
- Policy development and consultation summaries
- Grant proposals and program evaluations
- Regulatory submissions and interdepartmental memos
- Municipal, provincial, or NGO sector use
- Enterprise-level documentation in healthcare, education, or infrastructure

## Comparative Landscape: AI Tools in Government Document Automation
Several government and private sector tools offer lessons and parallels:

- **Humphrey (UK Cabinet Office)**: Used for public consultation analysis using GPT-like models. Shows strong governance focus and text transparency. We can learn from its validation tooling and public trust framing.
- **Deep Cognition‚Äôs PaperEntry AI (US)**: Automates data entry from government forms. Shows success of specialized tools for narrow, well-structured input domains. Reinforces importance of structured scaffolds and validation.
- **Lexis+ AI and CoCounsel (LegalTech)**: Used by lawyers to draft, revise, and search documents. Shows maturity in guided drafting, feedback loops, and use of large corpora for precedent search. Highlights potential to replicate contract-style drafting assistants.
- **CivicTech prototypes (e.g., PolicyKit, vTaiwan)**: Demonstrate participatory policy shaping with AI as assistant. Emphasize co-creation and civic transparency.

From these, we reuse:
- **Guided, schema-aligned drafting (from legaltech)**: Implement interview-style question prompts that align with templates (e.g., project rationale, scope, benefits) to help users provide inputs progressively. Also adopt modular drafting that mirrors how lawyers create clauses.
- **Document transparency and revision trails (from gov tools)**: Save all drafts with metadata, commit updates to GitHub or DMS with links, and capture chain-of-thought annotations so human reviewers understand both decisions and GPT output rationale.
- **Validation and checklists (from form-processing AI)**: Use structured YAML scaffolds and auto-checklists to ensure mandatory fields are completed before moving to export. Example: flag missing outcomes, cost estimates, or indicators.
- **Search + scaffold + revise loop (all domains)**: Allow users to search precedent examples, scaffold new sections using patterns or reusable blocks, and iteratively revise content via inline feedback prompts and rewrite tools.

## Additional Critical Considerations for Government Gating
To fully support complex, high-visibility, and auditable government submissions, the following must also be addressed:

- **Evidence-Based Decision Support**: Submissions must justify recommendations with data, options analysis, and alignment with strategic goals. GPT should prompt users to cite references, link to appendices, and use structured evidence frameworks.

- **Interdepartmental Alignment**: Proposals often span departments (e.g., Finance, Legal, Security). Enable routing of draft sections to stakeholders, tagging for review responsibility, and capturing of edits with attribution.

- **Governance Documentation**: Approval bodies expect clarity on roles and responsibilities. Provide RACI templates, embed endorsement forms, and track executive sign-offs as part of export metadata.

- **Audit Trails & Legal Defensibility**: All generated content should be timestamped, versioned, and traceable. Logs should include file lineage, GPT prompts/responses, and edits from reviewers.

- **Risk, Security, and Privacy Assessments**: Many gates require PIA, TRA, or architecture review. Include structured templates for each, and prompt users to include mandatory sections and security/privacy justifications.

- **Political Sensitivities and Cabinet Confidence**: Drafts must often remain confidential. Enable redaction flags, version labeling (e.g., DRAFT, FINAL), and secure file download options.

- **Bilingual Requirements**: Federal documents must often be bilingual. Build in translation prompts, dual-column scaffolds, or integration with language services.

- **Version Control and Approvals History**: Record who approved each version and when. Implement checklists with reviewer initials, gate status (e.g., G3 Approved), and links to signed versions.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- GPT output quality must meet public service tone and format expectations
- Source materials (transcripts, reference docs) are accessible early in the process
- Human-in-the-loop workflows are needed for governance and approval
- Current limitations in GPT length, formatting, and validation must be mitigated via structured tools
- Departments will accept GPT-supported documents as valid if human-reviewed and aligned with standards
