### 🔹 T2 - Digital services and transparency
```
The Policy on Service and Digital and the Directive on Open Government aim to promote transparency through the release of government information and data to the public. Departments are required to maximize the release of departmental information as an open resource, prioritize data based on public demand, and ensure compliance with security, privacy, and legal considerations. This promotes good governance by releasing high-value data first, ensuring timely release, and having efficient approval processes.
