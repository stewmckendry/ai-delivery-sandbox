## ✅ Test Results Report – Generate Section Chain with Corpus and GoC Alignment

### 📌 Summary
This test verified the integration of `queryPromptGenerator`, `queryCorpus`, and `goc_alignment_search` within the `generate_section_chain` pipeline. The section_synthesizer composed a draft based on available context and web search.

### 🧪 Test Outcome
✅ Test succeeded and produced a structured, detailed, evidence-based draft.

### 🧩 Tools Invoked
- `memory_retrieve`: Returned empty (no memory found)
- `web_search`: Returned 5 relevant web sources
- `queryPromptGenerator`: Generated a query based on project profile
- `queryCorpus`: Returned a strong chunk, but **was not used in draft prompt**
- `goc_alignment_search`: Returned empty
- `section_synthesizer`: Used only web search results
- `section_refiner`: Improved structure and grammar

### ⚠️ Issue Observed
- The synthesizer did **not** include queryCorpus results in the structured prompt, despite strong return.
  - Cause: Output from queryCorpus lacked metadata required for inclusion
  - Resolution: Patch section_synthesizer to recognize and format queryCorpus answer

### 📥 Trace ID
- `7c5d434b-f737-4a64-9cf8-dfd475572335`

### 📌 Next Steps
- Patch `section_synthesizer.py` to check and include `queryCorpus` response
- Confirm expected behavior with next test
