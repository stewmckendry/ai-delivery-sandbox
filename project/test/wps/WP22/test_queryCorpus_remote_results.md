# ✅ QueryCorpus Remote Tool – Test Results Report

## 🧪 Test Objective
Validate that `loadCorpus` and `queryCorpus` tools operate correctly in an asynchronous remote setup via Railway deployment.

---

## 🔁 Test Script Executed
File: [`test_queryCorpus_remote_http.py`](https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/blob/sandbox-curious-falcon/project/test/wps/WP22/test_queryCorpus_remote_http.py)

### 📝 Test Inputs
- PDF: Open Government Guidebook 2023 (GitHub raw URL)
- Queries:
  - "open government policy objectives"
  - "transparency and digital services"

### ✅ Expected Output
- Valid async `loadCorpus` response with `job_id`
- Accurate answers from `queryCorpus` using embedded chunk data

---

## 📊 Results
- `loadCorpus` returned: `{'status': 'accepted', 'job_id': '1ea347b7-1da2-43c8-b35b-4c6f6fe3650e'}` ✅
- 30s wait allowed async background task to finish indexing
- `queryCorpus` returned synthesized and contextually relevant answers for both queries ✅

---

## 🧱 Hiccups and Fixes
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|------|
| `loadCorpus` timed out on Railway | Made tool async using `BackgroundTasks` |
| First queries returned `None` | Added `time.sleep(30)` to test script |
| Invalid PDF on GitHub | Re-uploaded properly encoded version |
| Generic GPT answers in prior tests | Confirmed `queryCorpus` fallback behavior and enforced correct flow |

---

## ✅ Status
Test Passed – Asynchronous remote loading and querying works as intended.
