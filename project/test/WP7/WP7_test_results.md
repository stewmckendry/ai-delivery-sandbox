## WP7 Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Overview
This report documents the successful execution of the WP7 test suite covering the ingestion, section generation, and document assembly toolchains through `PlannerOrchestrator`. The test confirms the full pipeline executes as designed and data propagates through toolchains and the database correctly.

### üß™ Tests Executed
**1. IngestInputChain via PlannerOrchestrator**
- Input Method: `file`
- Result: ‚úÖ `project_profile` created and saved
- Notable Logs: `Loaded existing project profile`, `Merged with existing profile`, `Saved project profile`

**2. GenerateSectionChain via PlannerOrchestrator**
- Artifact: `investment_proposal_concept`, Section: `problem_statement`
- Result: ‚úÖ Section drafted and stored with associated `project_id`
- Notable Logs: `section_synthesizer complete`, `section_refiner complete`, `Saved to ArtifactSection and ReasoningTrace`

**3. AssembleArtifactChain via PlannerOrchestrator**
- Result: ‚úÖ Final document merged, formatted, uploaded to Drive
- Output: [Document Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qiyaHKDPun1d6FBSVlMPGoySb1TP9it6/view?usp=drivesdk)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hiccups & Fixes
1. **Mismatched Section ID** prevented the assemble chain from recognizing the section.
   - ‚úÖ Fixed by updating the `section_id` to match `gate_reference_v2.yaml`

2. **Missing project_id in web_search_log** due to incorrect variable mapping.
   - ‚úÖ Fixed the logging call to use correct `project_id`

### üßæ Logs and Traces
Attached artifacts:
- `generate_section_reasoning_trace.json`
- `doc_assembly_reasoning_trace.json`
- `screenshot_memory_tables.png`

### ‚úÖ Conclusion
WP7 passed all checkpoints. The end-to-end test confirms proper orchestration and project profile propagation across ingestion, generation, and assembly flows.
