## WP7 Test Results Report

**Objective:**
Validate end-to-end functionality of the Project Profile service from input ingestion to document assembly.

---

### ‚úÖ Overall Outcome
All components of the pipeline were successfully tested and verified. The project profile was correctly created, stored, and then loaded to support section generation and artifact assembly.

---

### üîç Test Coverage

**1. IngestInputChain via PlannerOrchestrator**
- Tool: `uploadFileInput`
- Outcome: Project profile successfully parsed and saved to the database.

**2. GenerateSectionChain via PlannerOrchestrator**
- Tools: `memory_retrieve`, `webSearch`, `section_synthesizer`, `section_refiner`
- Outcome: Section was synthesized, refined, and stored in the ArtifactSection table.

**3. AssembleArtifactChain via PlannerOrchestrator**
- Tools: `loadSectionMetadata`, `formatSection`, `mergeSections`, `finalizeDocument`, `storeToDrive`
- Outcome: Final document compiled and uploaded to Google Drive.

### üß© Issues & Fixes

**1. Section ID mismatch**
- **Issue:** Section ID created during drafting didn't match the reference schema.
- **Fix:** Updated section_id to match `gate_reference_v2.yaml` to ensure inclusion in the final document.

**2. web_search_log missing project_id**
- **Issue:** Pydantic schema error caused by undefined `project_id` in logging.
- **Fix:** Fixed by referencing the correct variable.

**3. SQL schema incompatibilities**
- Several fields were non-nullable initially (e.g., `title`) or mismatched types (e.g., `text` vs `varchar`).
- **Fix:** Dropped and recreated the table with updated field definitions based on which values are optional.

**4. JSON serialization errors**
- Fields like `Decimal` and `datetime` in project_profile were not serializable.
- **Fix:** Applied type coercion before serialization.

**5. Tool usage logging parameter mismatch**
- **Issue:** `log_tool_usage()` received an incorrect keyword.
- **Fix:** Renamed `tool` to `tool_name` to match the expected input schema.
