## WP18 Test Results Report – Version 2

### ✅ Objective
Finalize and validate fixes for `assemble_artifact` toolchain:
- Proper section title rendering
- Accurate markdown formatting
- Clean fallback removal and template structure

### 🧪 Follow-Up Fixes Tested
1. **Template Over-Rendering**
   - ❌ Previous bug: Full template repeated per section.
   - ✅ Fixed by rendering only the section block: `## {{ section_title }}` + `{{ text }}`.

2. **Content Placeholder Issue**
   - ❌ `{ text }` rendered literally due to escape bug.
   - ✅ Fixed by removing `{{{{ text }}}}` and replacing with `{{ text }}`.

3. **Missing Section Titles**
   - ❌ Section titles appeared as `{ section_title }`.
   - ✅ Fixed by passing `section_title` to `formatSection` from `loadSectionMetadata` and removing raw template fallback.

### ✅ Final Validation
- ✅ Re-ran full pipeline with artifact_id = `investment_proposal_concept`
- ✅ Output markdown is clean, readable, and accurate.
