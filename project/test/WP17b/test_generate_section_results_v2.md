## 🧪 Final Output
**Problem Statement: Decline in Public Transit Ridership**

Public transit, a crucial component of urban infrastructure, is presently grappling with a major challenge: a significant decrease in ridership over recent years. This decline primarily stems from unreliable schedules and the deterioration of aging infrastructure.

The survey indicates a striking 40% reduction in Metro Region ridership from 2019 to 2023. This dramatic decline emphasizes the immediate need to address the issues plaguing our public transit system.

In summary, the unreliability of transit schedules and decaying infrastructure are contributing to a marked decrease in public transit usage. It is critical to develop an investment proposal to tackle these issues, rejuvenate our public transit system, and regain users' trust.

## 📜 Trace Summary
- `memory_retrieve`: ['memory']
- `section_synthesizer`: ['prompt_used', 'raw_draft']
- `section_refiner`: ['prompt_used', 'refined_draft']

---

## 🧩 DB Entries Verified
- ✅ `ArtifactSection`: New record inserted with correct UUID and version field
- ✅ `ReasoningTrace`: Trace stored with full serialized step content

---

## ⚠️ Hiccups and Fixes
- **Primary Key Conflict**: Added `artifact_section_id` as new PK to allow multiple section versions
- **Trace Not Stored**: Fixed by JSON serializing `steps` in ReasoningTrace
- **Logging Failure**: `output_summary` was dict — now always stringified
- **Schema Mismatch**: Altered SQL Server table to match new model design

---

## ✅ Verdict
Toolchain now saves high-quality draft and rich reasoning trace with robust traceability. Ready for integration into document synthesis workflows.
