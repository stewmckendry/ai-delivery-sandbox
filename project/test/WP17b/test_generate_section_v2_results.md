# ✅ WP17b Test Results: `generate_section` Toolchain v2

## 🧪 Test Objective
Validate that the enhanced toolchain:
- Uses validated output schema
- Chunks drafts
- Stores chunk and version metadata in `ReasoningTrace`

---

## 📋 Test Summary
- ✅ Full draft generated and refined
- ✅ Chunks created by both tools and saved in DB
- ✅ Trace recorded full step log with version metadata
- ✅ No errors on database insert or output parsing

## 🖼️ Screenshots
- ArtifactSection: two successful rows with text content
- ReasoningTrace: full chunk array visible in `draft_chunks`
- PromptLog: entries for synthesizer, refiner, memory

## 🧱 Fixes Applied During Test
- Replaced `refined_draft` with `raw_draft` in `section_refiner.py` to match schema contract

---

## 📌 Final Output

```
Problem Statement

The Metro Region's public transit system is presently grappling with a significant problem, as indicated by a severe reduction in ridership. From 2019 to 2023, there was an alarming 40% decrease in transit users. This negative trend can be traced back to two main causes: inconsistent scheduling and the degradation of infrastructure.

Inconsistent schedules have resulted in commuter dissatisfaction, as they cannot depend on the transit system for regular travel. This inconsistency has had a profound impact on the use of public transit, discouraging habitual commuters and leading to a decline in overall ridership.

Moreover, the deteriorating infrastructure has also played a role in the reduced use of public transit. Aging infrastructure not only inconveniences riders but also raises safety concerns, which further dissuades potential users.

In conclusion, the dip in public transit ridership in the Metro Region is largely due to inconsistent schedules and decaying infrastructure. Addressing these issues is vital to reversing this negative trend and ensuring the survival and expansion of the public transit system.

## 📜 Trace Log
```
memory_retrieve: ['memory']
section_synthesizer: ['prompt_used', 'raw_draft', 'draft_chunks', 'tool_version', 'schema_version']
section_refiner: ['prompt_used', 'raw_draft', 'draft_chunks', 'tool_version', 'schema_version']
