# ✅ WP17b Test Results – Toolchain: generate_section

## 🎯 Objective
Validate end-to-end execution of the `generate_section` toolchain: `memory_retrieve` → `section_synthesizer` → `section_refiner`

---

## 🧪 Final Output
**SECTION: PROBLEM STATEMENT**

This investment proposal aims to resolve a critical issue identified within the public transit sector. Recent years have seen a notable decrease in public transit ridership, primarily due to unreliable schedules and outdated infrastructure, both of which have significantly impacted service efficiency and dependability. 

A recent regional survey offers quantifiable proof of this trend, revealing a dramatic 40% drop in Metro Region ridership from 2019 to 2023. This marked decrease underscores the urgency of the problem and the immediate need for intervention. 

As a result, this proposal aims to address these issues by suggesting strategic investments to enhance the reliability and reputation of our public transit system. In doing so, we hope to boost usage rates and serve our community more effectively.

## 📜 Trace Summary
- `memory_retrieve`: ['memory']
- `section_synthesizer`: ['prompt_used', 'raw_draft']
- `section_refiner`: ['prompt_used', 'refined_draft']

---

## ⚠️ Hiccups and Fixes
- **PromptLog field filtering**: Added dummy entries with correct JSON for artifact/section until upstream fixes arrive.
- **OpenAI SDK deprecation**: Migrated from `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` to `client.chat.completions.create()`.
- **Missing env variables**: Patched tools to use `dotenv` for local loading of `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Output trace structure**: Wrapped list output from `memory_retrieve` for trace alignment.
- **Railway log visibility**: Replaced print statements with `logger.info()`.

## ✅ Verdict
Toolchain works end-to-end and returns a well-structured, refined section draft. Trace logging is accurate and debuggable.

Ready to proceed with logging and storage integration.
