ðŸš€ GovDoc Copilot: AI Assistant for Project Management Docs â€” and Beyond
Coaching the Machine, Blog #5

What if writing a government business case, HR report, or compliance audit didnâ€™t mean starting from scratch?

Jesse Moon â€” a veteran public sector consultant and product leader â€” and I built GovDoc Copilot, a custom AI assistant designed for the Government of Canadaâ€™s Project Management Framework (PMF). But itâ€™s more than a PM tool â€” itâ€™s a reusable blueprint for AI-powered document generation across any domain.

ðŸ§  It understands structured processes â€” gates, policies, approvals â€” and guides you through research, drafting, revision, and finalization. Built with swappable components , it can just as easily power copilots for finance, HR, compliance, or strategy.

ðŸ“˜ In the blog, we cover:
âœ… How we combined AI + tools + human judgment to co-produce real policy docs
ðŸ§­ A full user journey (from brainstorming to final Gate 0 doc)
ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s under the hood: ontology, memory, tools, orchestration
ðŸ”„ Where this model goes next: finance, HR, strategy, and beyond
