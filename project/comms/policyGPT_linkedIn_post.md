🚀 GovDoc Copilot: AI Assistant for Project Management Docs — and Beyond
Coaching the Machine, Blog #5 + First Video Demo

What if drafting a government business case felt more like working with a capable teammate—and less like starting from a blank page?

In this episode of Coaching the Machine, Jesse Moon and I showcase GovDoc Copilot: PM Edition, a custom GPT + toolchain built for the Government of Canada’s Project Management Framework (PMF). It’s more than a document generator—it's a full-stack AI assistant that collaborates across the lifecycle of public sector project delivery.

🧠 What makes it different?
It understands structured frameworks like PMF. It pulls in your real inputs—notes, policies, research. And it walks you through each section with built-in QA, alignment, and memory.

🎯 We built it to:
- Draft Business Cases, Charters, and more—fast, structured, and policy-aligned
- Support PMs and digital teams with reusable building blocks: GPT + ontology + memory + tools
- Be configurable for any domain: HR, finance, compliance, and beyond
