### 1. Options Considered

The workshop began by brainstorming multiple pathways for addressing AI talent capacity in the federal government:

- **Option A: Internal Upskilling Program**  
  Train existing public servants in AI/ML through formal training, peer learning cohorts, and project-based rotations.

- **Option B: Dedicated AI Talent Stream in Recruitment Programs**  
  Create a specialized hiring channel under GC recruitment programs targeting AI specialists.

- **Option C: Interchange & Fellowships**  
  Leverage private/public sector partnerships to embed AI professionals into government teams temporarily.

- **Option D: Centralized AI Services Hub**  
  Stand up a central team (e.g., within TBS or SSC) to provide AI expertise on demand across departments.

### 2. Options Analysis

| Option | Feasibility | Scalability | Time to Impact | Strategic Fit |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| A. Upskilling | High | Medium | Medium | Strong alignment with public service values |
| B. Talent Stream | Medium | High | Slow | Dependent on classification and hiring reform |
| C. Interchange | High | Low | Fast | Easy to pilot but hard to scale |
| D. Services Hub | Medium | Medium | Medium | Could duplicate efforts if not well integrated |

Discussion highlighted that Options A and C could be combined as a phased approach: build internal skills while bridging gaps via fellowships.

### 3. Preliminary Costs & Benefits

**Costs**  
- Option A: ~$2–4M annually for training, curriculum, backfill support
- Option B: ~$1M/year for outreach, candidate pipeline, policy work
- Option C: $500K–1M/year depending on partner cost-sharing
- Option D: TBD – subject to team sizing and cross-department buy-in

**Benefits**  
- Reduced reliance on external vendors
- Better alignment of AI capabilities with public sector values
- More durable capacity building over time

### 4. Initial Risks

- **Talent Retention:** Upskilled staff may still exit without incentive structures
- **Equity & Inclusion:** Programs must avoid reinforcing access gaps
- **Fragmentation:** Risk of overlapping initiatives across departments
- **Policy Alignment:** Needs clarity on legal/privacy guardrails for applied AI

---

**Next Steps:**
- Flesh out combined A+C model for further costing
- Begin drafting preliminary business case narrative
- Identify quick win pilots for 2025–26 cycle
