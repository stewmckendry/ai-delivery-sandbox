### Session Purpose
Kickstart shared understanding and framing for the AI Talent Initiative. Align on why this matters now, what success looks like, and how we’ll shape the program together.

---

### Opening Remarks
Facilitator opened with a reminder: this isn’t about *just* hiring data scientists — it’s about enabling Canada’s public service to deliver in an AI-powered era.

> “We have the ambition, now we need the capability.”

---

### What’s the Problem We’re Solving?
Group shared a flurry of post-its and jamboard notes. Common themes:

- **Capacity gap**: Most departments don’t have in-house AI practitioners.
- **Reliance on vendors**: “We outsource both execution *and* thinking.”
- **Speed vs. sovereignty**: Fast delivery is critical, but we need to own the core.
- **Lost context**: External consultants deliver models — but internal teams can’t maintain or adapt them.

---

### Why Now?
- “Demand is exploding” — every department wants to explore AI use cases.
- AI policy frameworks are in place (responsible AI, privacy, etc.) — but execution is slow.
- Global peers are moving fast — Singapore, UK, Estonia.

---

### What Could This Look Like?
Group brainstorm on whiteboard:

**Top 5 Program Components** (voted)

1. Central GC talent pool with rotating placements
2. AI Fellowship program for early-career recruits
3. Clear job streams: Data scientist, ML engineer, AI advisor
4. Academic and industry partnerships (Vector, Mila, CIFAR)
5. Shared dev environments + reusable tools/templates

### Risks & Worries
💬 “We’ve tried digital hiring before — procurement and HR slowed us down.”  
💬 “If departments build in silos, we won’t get lift-off.”  
💬 “We need to show value fast or momentum will fade.”

Mitigation Ideas:
- Stand up 3 pilot teams in Q3
- Align with flagship GC AI projects
- Use GovDoc Co-Pilot to automate early-stage artifacts

---

### What Does Success Look Like?
Workshop participants defined success in sticky notes:

- “When hiring a data scientist is as routine as hiring a policy analyst.”
- “When we no longer have to buy basic AI prototypes externally.”
- “When AI is part of delivery — not an add-on.”
