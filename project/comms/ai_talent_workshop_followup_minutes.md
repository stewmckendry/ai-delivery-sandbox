**Date:** 2025-06-03  
**Facilitator:** Jesse Moon  
**Participants:** PMO Team, GovAI Strategy Unit, Departmental HR and Planning Representatives, Digital Talent Office, Treasury Board Secretariat (observer)

### 1. Purpose
Follow-up to the initial workshop on AI talent expansion, this session focused on refining problem definitions, confirming strategic alignment, and clarifying key inputs for the investment proposal concept and project charter.

### 2. Recap of Initial Workshop
- Identified the growing demand for AI capability across GoC departments
- Defined early goals around talent attraction, development, and redeployment
- Outlined draft project gating path and required artifacts
- Introduced GovDoc Copilot as a support tool for artifact generation

### 3. Refined Problem Statement Inputs
Participants revisited problem areas and added:
- Difficulty scaling technical talent with AI fluency in core and enabling roles
- Fragmentation in existing talent programs and poor visibility across departments
- Long hiring cycles versus the pace of AI adoption and opportunity
- Lack of clear pathways for current employees to move into AI-enabling roles

### 4. Investment Logic Inputs
- Departments have varied maturity and readiness but face consistent resourcing constraints
- Small targeted investments can yield high ROI if they unlock internal capacity
- Alignment with recent mandates from Treasury Board on digital workforce readiness

### 5. Early Vision Statements
Several strawman statements were drafted:
- "Empower departments with an AI-fluent workforce through scalable upskilling, strategic hires, and cross-departmental mobility."
- "Reduce GoC's reliance on external AI consulting by building sustainable, in-house AI delivery talent."

Participants agreed on the need to:
- Anchor on value-for-money and strategic capacity-building
- Make sure language and goals work across large and small departments

### 6. Dependencies & Integration Points
- Must align with existing enterprise talent platforms and HR transformation efforts
- Explore links to DTA, CSPS, and GC Talent Cloud initiatives
- Integrate with digital credentials work to track competencies across orgs

### 7. Next Steps
- Use these minutes and initial outputs to drive Project Charter development
- Schedule working sessions to:
  - Flesh out project scope and success metrics
  - Refine key sections of the investment proposal using GovDoc Copilot
  - Map governance and stakeholder engagement plans
