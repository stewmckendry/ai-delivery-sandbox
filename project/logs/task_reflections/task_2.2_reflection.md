## âœ… Task 2.2 â€“ Build & Patch: Reflection Log

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Implement all MVP endpoints, schemas, interfaces, and supporting code for the AI CareerCoach backend to allow GPT-based interaction with coaching content and journaling memory.

---

### ðŸ›  What We Delivered
- **4 endpoints**: `load_prompt`, `get_yaml_segment`, `save_reflection`, `fetch_summary`
- **Memory layer** with Airtable + Notion API integration
- **Schemas** for prompts, segments, reflections, summaries
- **YAML + prompt loaders** for GitHub-hosted content
- **OpenAPI spec** with GPT tool metadata and production server
- **`.env.template`** to prep for deployment
- **Tested endpoints**, added validation, and patched schema bugs
- **Build logs and backlog** kept fully updated

---

### ðŸ§  Highlights
- Adopted a batch-based delivery model (scope â†’ generate â†’ test â†’ log)
- Identified and resolved an overwrite bug (Batch 4), added RCA
- Standardized file patching to prevent context drift
- Used `x-gpt-action` and examples to make endpoints GPT-usable

---

### ðŸ“Œ Learnings
- Always fetch latest files before patching in long sessions
- Commit incrementally to ensure traceability
- Structured logging helps handoff and future debugging

---

Task ready to hand off. Recommend closing this task and launching Task 2.3: deployment setup and testing.
