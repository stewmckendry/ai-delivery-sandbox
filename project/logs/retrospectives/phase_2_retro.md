## 🔁 Phase 2 Retrospective – Build & Spec

### 🧱 What We Did
- Designed technical spec from architecture docs (Task 2.1)
- Delivered full MVP system across 4 routes
- Built YAML loaders, memory manager, and Airtable/Notion clients
- Added input validation, testing, and error handling
- Created OpenAPI spec with GPT tool instructions
- Logged updates in batches with traceable commits and backlogs

### 💡 What Went Well
- Batch-based delivery model kept scope focused and testable
- Upfront architectural alignment prevented rework
- Use of GPT tool contracts improved clarity for API consumers
- Logs and patching reduced risk of drift or rework

### ⚠️ What Could Improve
- Commit errors (Batch 4) revealed need for better bulk file patching
- Lacked a way to append a reasoning trace after task completion

### 🛠 What We Changed
- Adopted fetch-edit-commit pattern for all file updates
- Logged RCA for overwrite bug and added enhancement for `log_trace`

### ✅ Outcomes
- System is stable, testable, and aligned with the spec
- Handed off cleanly to Task 2.8 for deployment

Looking forward to Phase 3 testing and integration!
