## 🕵️ Root Cause Analysis – Batch 4 Commit Bug

### 🎯 Incident Summary
During Batch 4 implementation (`/fetch_summary`), only one file (`routes/memory.py`) was committed initially. The other files (`schemas/summary.py`, `utils/memory_manager.py`, `clients/airtable_client.py`) silently failed to commit, with no error returned. Manual commits were needed afterward.

### 🧠 Root Cause
The root cause appears to be **context overrun or loss of file buffer references** due to:
- The file set being held in memory was not re-fetched from Git after the partial commit.
- A bulk rewrite pattern might have lost track of uncommitted files.

### 🛠 Fix Implemented
All multi-step file updates now follow a **safe append pattern**:
1. **Fetch the latest file version from Git** before editing.
2. **Patch or append the required content**.
3. **Submit updated file explicitly** to avoid stale state.

This has worked consistently for both:
- `mvp_build_backlog.md`
- `build_batches.md`

### ✅ Lessons Learned
- Never assume local state = latest Git state during large batches.
- Always fetch before patching shared or multi-edit files.

### 🔁 Preventative Action
- Add a safe commit utility or macro to fetch-edit-patch-submit in one atomic action.
- Ensure changelog validation alerts on missing files if a partial batch commit occurs.
