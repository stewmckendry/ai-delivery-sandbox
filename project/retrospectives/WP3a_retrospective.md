# 🔍 WP3a Retrospective – Planner + Memory Layer

## ✅ What Went Well
- **CLI-first build** enabled rapid development and testability without UI dependencies.
- **Trace logging and replay mode** worked smoothly on the first pass.
- **Schema alignment** was proactive — reusable models and trace structure validated early.
- **Cross-WP clarity** helped streamline handoff to WP3b and WP4.

## 🧠 What We Learned
- Replaying toolchains without side effects is a powerful debug pattern.
- Clear split between live and replay flows made testing deterministic.
- Logging locally is useful for dev, but DB/storage planning is essential downstream.

## 🛠️ What Could Be Improved
- `TOOL_CATALOG` wiring came late; should stub early.
- Planner toolchains should be centrally documented — maybe as YAML.
- DB setup steps should be scaffolded earlier even if unconnected.

## 🔜 Suggestions for Next Pods
- Add CLI script or wrapper to run test suite end-to-end.
- Use hash/snapshot ID in filenames for traceability.
- Standardize trace YAML structure across pods.
