## WP16 Retrospective â€“ Input Prompt UX Layer

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Build the user experience layer for collecting and structuring user inputs for gate artifacts in PolicyGPT.

---

### âœ… What Went Well
- Strong schema alignment across tools with `gate_reference_v2.yaml`
- Smooth build + patch sequence: prompt tools, input ingestion, metadata logging
- Cloud vector DB deployment using Chroma with FastAPI integration
- GPT-ready schemas and prompt flows
- End-to-end testing captured real tool usage

---

### ðŸ§  What We Learned
- Importance of consistent metadata tagging (gate, artifact, section, intent)
- Tool registry and schema validation caught multiple bugs early
- Vector DB local vs. cloud distinction critical for PoC success
- Logging with `logger` much more reliable than `print` in Railway deploys

---

### ðŸš§ What Could Be Improved
- Initial Chroma API usage assumptions delayed testing
- Schema mismatch on session_id/user_id in test payloads was not surfaced clearly
- Lack of prompt record snapshots or session viewer UI for deeper inspection

---

### ðŸª„ Ideas for the Future
- Prompt-to-draft trace visualization per session
- Integrate `queryCorpus` and document highlighter in review UI
- Tagging system to link prompt intents to GPT config auto-suggestions

---

### ðŸ“Œ Final Status
**âœ… WP Complete** with clean handoff, test coverage, and downstream guidance.
**ðŸ”œ Follow-Up** tasks logged in completion note for Pod Lead.
