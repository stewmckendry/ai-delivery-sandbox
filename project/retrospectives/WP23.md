### WP23 Retrospective

---

#### ðŸš€ What Went Well
- All tools and the full toolchain were successfully implemented and passed test scenarios.
- Effective use of LLMs for complex NLP tasks: parsing, rewriting, validating.
- Prompt templates provided clean abstraction and easier prompt management.
- Logging with PromptLog and revision_trace provides full transparency and debugging support.
- Summarization strategy helped avoid token overflows and retained semantic fidelity.

#### ðŸ§  Learnings
- Feedback mapping is challenging without section contextâ€”adding section summaries helped.
- Clear definitions of revision types (e.g., verbatim vs. rewrite) are critical.
- Modular tool approach scales better and enables reuse in other chains.
- Test-first and trace-based debugging accelerated quality assurance.

#### ðŸ§© Challenges
- Feedback not always clearly mappable to one section.
- Ensuring LLM revisions respect feedback intent was non-trivial.
- Balancing token usage with full context fidelity required experimentation.

#### ðŸ›  Improvements for Future
- Automate multi-feedback flows
- Improve LLM prompt compliance checking heuristics
- Consider structured metadata for revision suggestions
- Integrate this capability into full doc-level revise chain

#### ðŸ™Œ Thanks
- Human Lead for thoughtful feedback and full-cycle testing.
- LLMs for their surprisingly strong rewriting, parsing, and judgment capabilities.
- Engineering stack for robust prompt, trace, and logging infrastructure.
