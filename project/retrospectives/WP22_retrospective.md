# WP22 Retrospective – GoC Alignment Search Tool

## ✅ What Went Well
- **Clear Objectives**: WP22 had well-scoped, user-centric goals.
- **Strong Integration**: Smooth orchestration across tools, toolchains, and databases.
- **Successful Asynchronicity**: Moving `loadCorpus` to async resolved timeouts.
- **Modular Design**: Tools like `queryCorpus` and `goc_alignment_search` are reusable across contexts.
- **Testing Rigor**: Remote and local test plans and automation validated end-to-end behavior.
- **Prompt Hygiene**: Structured, labeled prompts enhanced synthesizer performance.

## 🔧 What Could Be Improved
- **Initial Tool Conventions**: First versions didn’t follow `Tool` class structure — required rework.
- **Search Query Specificity**: Default artifact/section ID queries were vague. Synthesized prompt fixed this.
- **Corpus Input UX**: Embedded corpus loading relies on local setup; future: add upload API.
- **Railway Timeout**: Need better feedback to user on async load progress.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Use real content to validate assumptions (GoC PDFs revealed path issues).
- Query quality drives tool value — synthesize from memory+profile.
- Labeling and summarizing inputs is essential to manage prompt length + relevance.
- Async jobs require a signaling or polling interface for production usage.

## 📌 Recommendations
- Expand `goc_alignment_search` to support multilingual search.
- Add confidence scoring to corpus matches.
- Introduce draft quality metrics (traceable to source type).
- Enable corpus tagging + filtering (e.g., strategy vs mandate letter).
- Integrate into UI tools with status indicators for async jobs.

## 🏁 Completion Summary
- All planned WP22 tasks were completed.
- Tools deployed, integrated, and validated via test scripts.
- Ready for use by downstream GPTs and pods.
