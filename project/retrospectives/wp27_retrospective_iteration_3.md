## 🔍 WP27 Retrospective – Iteration 3

### ✅ What Went Well
- 🎯 Clear mission scope: Anchored around realistic section drafting and document flow
- 🔁 Smooth iterative build: All new toolchains chained logically into the UX
- 🧠 Great reuse: `plan_sections` logic helped enforce ordering across systems
- 🧱 Chunking success: Redis+token-aware slicing supported long document outputs
- 🧪 Testing mindset: All components validated locally before chaining

### 🤔 What Was Surprising
- Chunking was harder than expected — deciding when, how, and what metadata to retain took effort
- Redis plugin setup was more manual than anticipated (Railway + VS Code integration)
- Some latent token risks exist when entire artifact is returned — chunking is necessary

### 🚧 What Could Improve
- 🔄 Earlier scaffolding of final user journey to identify tool gaps
- 🔍 Better UX trace during long runs — checkpoint save, chunk preview, token counter
- 🧩 Need clearer distinction between long-term memory (DB) and ephemeral stores (Redis)

### 💡 Key Learnings
- Drafting across sections needs high fidelity to section order and intent alignment
- GPT can't see full context reliably without chunking + orchestration
- Global context is best summarized once and passed — avoids redundant memory scans

### 📚 Tools & Tech Wins
- ✅ Redis integration for ephemeral draft storage
- ✅ YAML-based section ordering via `gate_reference_v2`
- ✅ Clean logs, token tracking, prompt hygiene

### 🛣️ What’s Next
- Build `revise_section_chain`
- Feedback loop + checkpoints UX
- Add GPT scoring + review mode
- E2E test with human feedback simulated

### 🙏 Appreciation
Thanks to the prior pod for setting a solid foundation and clean repo structure. It made chaining easy. Let’s keep the rhythm going!
