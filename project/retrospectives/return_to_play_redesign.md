# ðŸ§  Retrospective: Return-to-Play Flow Redesign

**Date:** 2025-05-13  
**Pod:** ProductPod  
**Task ID:** 3.2_execute_e2e_scenarios

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Redesign the concussion recovery journey to align with SCAT6 principles, making the system more realistic, flexible, and supportive through daily check-ins, contextual guidance, and structured activity tracking.

---

## âœ… What Went Well
- **Stage inference logic** was redesigned from arbitrary scoring to activity-confirmed progression based on symptom severity and time.
- **New tools** like `log_activity_checkin`, `get_stage_overview`, and `get_checkin_flow` added meaningful structure to support recovery.
- **OpenAPI and system instructions** were fully updated to guide GPT through realistic and supportive conversations.
- **Export tools** were refactored to provide full context, including activity logs and criteria behind stage assignments.
- **Empathetic UX** was embedded in all prompts and tool instructions, improving clarity and safety.

---

## ðŸ¤” What Could Be Improved
- **Earlier integration of SCAT6 guidance** would have avoided rework on stage criteria logic.
- **Symptom logging** process had legacy tools that introduced some confusion during the redesign.
- **More proactive versioning** could help isolate legacy vs. redesigned tools for staging and rollout.

---

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned
- Staging recovery is more than symptom severity â€” context matters (time, activity, behavior).
- GPT logic benefits from clear YAML maps and fallback strategies for cold start or missing data.
- A good summary tool should reflect the journey, not just log entries.

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps
- Complete scenario 2 E2E testing on the new flow
- Document updated prompt patterns in test and delivery artifacts
- Monitor for edge cases and symptom nuances in activity logging
