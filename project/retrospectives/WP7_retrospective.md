## WP7 Retrospective: Project Profile Integration

### ‚úÖ What Went Well
- **Full E2E Flow Validated**: Successfully executed ingestion ‚Üí generation ‚Üí assembly.
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Profile fields handled gracefully when missing.
- **PlannerOrchestrator Routing**: Ensured all major toolchains used it correctly.
- **Test Runner Alignment**: Final test script simulates real user flow.
- **Rapid Iteration**: Debug-feedback-fix loop yielded high velocity.

### üß† Lessons Learned
- **Project Profile is Central**: Requires early ingestion, frequent update, and propagation.
- **Null Handling in SQL**: Must align ORM, schema, and DB constraints.
- **Tool vs. Toolchain Confusion**: Orchestration logic must always call the orchestrator.
- **Schema-Safe Logging**: `Decimal`, `datetime`, and nested objects must be cleaned before logging.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pain Points
- Multiple patch cycles for schema enforcement.
- Serialization issues across chains.
- Tool registration vs. schema mismatch caught late.
- Missed branch tags led to commits to `main`.

### üìà Improvements for Future WPs
- Standardize schema casting/cleaning utils
- Formalize `project_profile` versioning and history
- Build test harness with mocks and auto-validation
- Auto-validate against `gate_reference.yaml`

### üôå Kudos
- Successful test result and clean logs
- Profile now integrates into all downstream logic
- Team collaboration across schema, toolchain, orchestrator, and tests
