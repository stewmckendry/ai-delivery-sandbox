# Retrospective: Tool Refactor and Schema Alignment (Feature 3)

## Scope
This retrospective covers the testing, bug fixing, and schema alignment work performed across all tools in Feature 3. It focused on improving tool reliability, clarifying the OpenAPI schemas, and ensuring consistent user experience and data flow logic.

## Summary of Work Completed
- **Tool Testing**: All tool endpoints were tested individually and in sequence via the Custom GPT interface and API logs.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - `assess_concussion`: Fixed symptom input parsing, red flag logic, and DB handling.
  - `log_incident_detail`: Ensured scores are logged with symptoms, default fallback added.
  - `log_symptoms`: Refactored to handle detailed symptom input with matching logic and score handling.
  - `get_stage_guidance`: Now supports "quick checks" without full triage, stores results in `RecoveryCheck`.
  - `get_symptom_log_map`: Confirmed intent and metadata structure.
  - Removed unused or outdated files: `db_writer.py`, `validator.py`.
- **Schema Fixes**:
  - Updated all OpenAPI tool schemas for property alignment, examples, and better GPT instructions.
  - Enhanced GPT action instructions for each tool.
- **Workflow Enhancements**:
  - Added `skip_if` logic to triage flow.
  - Matched symptom input to reference YAML with fallback.
  - Ensured scores are collected and meaningful (1–10 scale).
  - Improved GPT responses to include clinical-style recommendations.

## Lessons Learned
- GPT schema instructions need to be specific but not overloaded.
- Backed-in DB logic (rather than payload-driven) helps reduce GPT errors.
- Consistent naming and fallback handling (e.g. symptom score, red flag logic) reduce friction across tools.

## Remaining Risks
- GPT still sometimes needs reminders to follow schema exactly.
- Complex triage flows can still confuse conversational logic—skip logic helped, but additional training may improve it further.

## Next Steps
- Run end-to-end scenarios in ProductionPod.
- Consider future usability improvements in GPT prompt engineering.
- Continue monitoring DB logs and user-reported symptoms for unexpected edge cases.
