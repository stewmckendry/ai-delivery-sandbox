### WP12 Retrospective – Dense Artifact Generation Design

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### 🎯 What Went Well
- Collaborative design sessions with Lead Pod clarified ambiguous flows
- Captured complex GPT + tool interactions in a single orchestration diagram
- Clear mapping of tools and handoffs to specific WPs
- Surfaced ambiguity in UX vs backend responsibilities early

---

### ⚠️ What Could Be Improved
- Tool purpose and data flow need to be clearer in early design phase
- Dependencies between prompting and session memory were discovered late

---

### 📌 Suggestions for Future Pods
- Anchor designs to session memory and data contracts upfront
- Define how LLMs will interface with tools before writing code
- Use composite diagrams to reduce ambiguity for backend/UX split

---

### 🧠 Noted Issues
- Unclear tool ownership for template orchestration and slotting logic (now assigned to WP17)
- No early validation of how prompting templates flow through tool orchestration
