### 🔁 WP1a Retrospective – Scaffolding + Assembly

**Pod:** WP1aPod  
**Phase:** Build  
**Task:** 2.2_build_and_patch

---

### ✅ What Went Well

- **Strong alignment with system design.** Tooling adhered to `gate_reference`, system architecture, and gating doc quality standards.
- **Early feedback loop.** CLI tools were quickly validated by Human Lead in local environment.
- **Modular tool structure.** Each phase (scaffold, expand, assemble) was separated and testable in isolation.
- **Reusability confirmed.** The framework generalizes well across gates/artifacts.

---

### 🤯 What Was Hard

- **Schema mismatch in `gate_reference_v2.yaml`.** Required fixes to interpret gate IDs as integers and locate artifact/section structures in lists.
- **Missing output logic in assembler.** Initially lacked CLI args for writing Markdown and JSON — needed patching mid-test.
- **Ambiguity in early ownership of memory integration.** Clarified this is out-of-scope for WP1a, but important for WP2+.

---

### 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Validate reference schemas at kickoff using real test inputs.
- Assume next Pods will build on stub logic — scaffold clear seams.
- CLI is a low-friction way to validate build intent.
- Explicit output paths help downstream automation.

---

### 💡 Suggestions for Future Pods

- Include `gate_reference_v2.yaml` structure in test plan early
- Use `--ref_path` CLI flags to override YAML source cleanly
- Output sample `.md` and `.json` for each artifact in test suite
- Confirm pod interface expectations (e.g. `section_id` handling)
