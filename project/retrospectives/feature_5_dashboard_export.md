## 🔍 Retrospective: Feature 5 – Dashboard + Data Export

### ✅ What We Delivered
- **Export Tools**: `export_to_sql.py` + `reference_loader.py` to enable structured data export
- **Metadata Pipeline**: Enriched symptom tracking with `reporter_type`, `sport_type`, `team_id`, etc.
- **Orchestration Tools**: `log_incident_detail`, `log_symptoms`, `get_triage_flow`, etc.
- **Schema Upgrades**: YAML, models, and DB updated to persist and flow metadata
- **PDF/FHIR/SQL**: All export formats now include system-level metadata

### ⚙️ Integration Achievements
- Azure Blob upload confirmed and integrated
- Metadata backfill in `log_symptoms` via TrackerMetadata fallback
- GPT orchestration clarified and implemented

### 📘 Lessons Learned
- Metadata must be designed top-down and validated bottom-up
- TrackerState serves as the critical unifier across tools
- GPT UX design should include clear tool invocation patterns

### 📌 Opportunities for Future Work
- Add scheduling or cron-like export mode
- Real Power BI dashboard integration
- Greater GPT awareness of triage flow logic
