## WP7 Retrospective

### ✅ What Went Well
- 🔁 **Smooth E2E Integration**: All toolchains now interoperate using the project_profile service.
- 🧠 **Project Profile Centralization**: Consistent access to project-level metadata enabled richer outputs.
- 🧪 **Test Coverage**: Full pipeline tested via test_runner with real DB writes and artifact uploads.
- 🔍 **Error Discovery and Fixes**: Traced multiple issues (SQL, JSON, ID mismatches) and resolved them methodically.

### 🧱 What We Built
- `IngestInputChain`
- `ProjectProfileEngine`
- DB schema for `project_profile`
- Planner orchestration for all major chains

### 🧩 Challenges
- 🔢 SQL schema rigidity: Required dropping/recreating tables due to legacy constraints.
- 🧾 Serialization pain: `Decimal`, `datetime` required custom handling for JSON logs.
- 🧪 Tool validation: Caught mismatches in section_id vs. reference schema late in the flow.

### 🚧 Improvements
- Use version-controlled migrations for DB changes.
- Enhance PlannerOrchestrator test harness to simulate more edge cases.
- Consider a fallback profile when DB profile is missing.

### 🙏 Thanks To...
- Team for collaboration on PlannerOrchestrator refactor
- Debugging crew who stepped through logs and tracebacks line by line
- Early testers who exposed section and toolchain mismatches

### 📌 Final Thought
WP7 turned project_profile from an idea into a living, integrated service. We're now better equipped to personalize outputs, retain context, and scale the intelligence of our delivery pipeline.
