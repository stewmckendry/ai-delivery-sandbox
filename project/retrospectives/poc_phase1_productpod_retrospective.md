## title: PoC Phase 1 ProductPod Retrospective

## Context
This retrospective summarizes the design and scoping effort undertaken by ProductPod for Phase 1 of the PolicyGPT proof of concept. The goal was to establish feasibility, system coherence, and government-grade quality standards for automated gating documentation generation.

---

## Accomplishments

- Defined 13 interlocking system design artifacts from architecture to integration points
- Created full tool catalog, API contracts, error handling model
- Designed session memory to preserve edits and prompts across sessions
- Anchored feature/acceptance alignment in every document
- Integrated upstream policy research (Gate Reference YAML, Implementation Spec)
- Performed multi-perspective Go/No Go Review (developer, DG/DM, CIO, PM, vendor, investor)
- Received Go decision with minor follow-ups and high stakeholder confidence

---

## Key Strengths

- Document quality bar upheld across drafts, commit, and tool contracts
- Document composition model handles token limits via chunking, Drive fallback
- DB schema, YAML, and logs form tight audit and recovery layer
- FastAPI scaffolding documented and build-ready
- Prompt patterns and config YAMLs deliver consistent GPT outputs

---

## Challenges

- Iteration speed vs. depth tradeoff
- Initial alignment gaps between journey/tools/schema took cycles to correct
- Scaleout logic for session/token overflow needed further detailing

---

## Lessons Learned

- All system design documents benefit from feature alignment tables and unknown/constraint sections
- Canvas-based drafting + direct Git commits created a seamless product flow
- Formal tone and long-form structure needed to be repeatedly reinforced in prompts + instructions
- Integrated testing and validation planning should begin earlier in design phase
