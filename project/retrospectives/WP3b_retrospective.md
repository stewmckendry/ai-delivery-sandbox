### 🔍 Retrospective — WP3b Tool Wrapping + API

**Pod:** WP3bPod  
**Repo:** `ai-delivery-sandbox`  
**Branch:** `sandbox-curious-falcon`

---

### ✅ What Went Well
- 🧩 Designed a fully modular and schema-driven tool registry system with CLI + API + GPT interfaces
- 🚀 Deployed to Railway with zero-config cloud setup and Git-based schema loading
- 🧪 Validation logic worked consistently across test modes with real-time API error handling
- 📓 Documentation was kept up to date and useful for onboarding downstream WPs

---

### ⚠️ What Was Tricky
- 🚧 Schema enforcement and early tool stubbing needed to be pushed from WP3b to other pods — ideally would have had earlier alignment
- 🔁 `tool_catalog.yaml` and `gpt_tools_manifest.json` needed rigorous merge handling due to multiple dependencies
- 🔍 Error visibility required mid-task fix to return validation messages client-side

---

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Always stub and validate tools early — even placeholder logic allows fast end-to-end testing
- Log validation errors in a consistent and client-visible format
- GitHub-based loading was critical for reliability and should be a default in production

---

### 📌 Recommendations for Future WPs
- Use WP3b’s tool registry and schemas as the single source of truth
- Add `doc_id`, `gate_id`, and `section_id` fields early in any tool schemas
- Standardize output with Markdown + JSON if tools will be reused in UIs
