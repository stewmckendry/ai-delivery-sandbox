### ðŸªž Retrospective â€” WP3b Tool Wrapping + API

**Pod:** WP3bPod  
**Phase:** Build & Patch  
**Dates:** 2025-05-13 to 2025-05-21

---

### âœ… What Went Well
- Clear scope and high-quality input files enabled fast onboarding
- CLI-first validation enabled debugging before exposing tools via API
- Git-based schema loading gave us a flexible and versioned control point
- Modular tool wrappers + trace system will scale well across WPs
- Working closely with the Human Lead ensured rapid decisions and iteration

---

### ðŸ¤” What Could Be Improved
- GitHub loader logic was introduced late and might benefit from earlier inclusion in architecture
- Tool ownership was unclear for a few entries â€” surfaced during midpoint mapping
- Initial Railway deploy failed due to default `python main.py` â€” FastAPI nuance
- Stubbed tools should ideally include a dummy response template to help downstream testing

---

### ðŸ’¡ Recommendations
- Assign tool build responsibilities explicitly during WP scoping to prevent gaps
- Use schema-driven validation and logging as a shared interface standard across WPs
- Surface tool manifest and test scaffold to WP4 and WP5 early to unblock integration

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Impact
WP3b delivered a registry and runtime contract that unlocks tooling and orchestration across the PolicyGPT system. With schema validation, manifest discovery, and test infrastructure, other WPs can build safely and transparently.
