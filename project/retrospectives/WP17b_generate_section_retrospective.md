## ✅ What Went Well
- 🧱 **Solid Architecture**: Toolchain and planner pattern proved clean, extensible, and easy to test
- 🤖 **GPT Integration**: LLM-driven synthesis and refinement was seamless and high quality
- 💾 **End-to-End Flow**: From PromptLog to DB persistence worked with full testability
- 📚 **Documentation**: Each step was documented and committed, making this WP a reference implementation
- 🧪 **Test Rigor**: Multiple rounds of CLI test + SQL assertions gave strong confidence

## 🤔 What Could Be Improved
- 🔐 **Auth Context**: `session_id` / `user_id` should be injected earlier in the pipeline
- 🧱 **DB Design Handoff**: Required mid-stream fix to switch primary key for ArtifactSection
- 📦 **Embeddings Access**: Skipped for now due to missing `queryCorpus`
- 🔁 **Too Many Tool Layers**: Multiple places to register tools and toolchains — could be abstracted

## 💡 Lessons & Recommendations
- ✅ Build CLI-first, test early, test often
- ✅ Keep GPT tool wrappers modular, composable
- ✅ Log everything with trace IDs and outputs
- 🧠 Document intent-to-toolchain planner map clearly for reuse
- 🧱 Design tables with extensibility (no singleton PKs on business keys)

## 🗂️ Artifacts
- Toolchain: `generate_section`
- Tools: `memory_retrieve`, `section_synthesizer`, `section_refiner`
- Test Plans + Results
- DB Models + SQL Patches
- Planner + Registration Guide

## 📤 Status
✅ Build complete – outputs integrated into DB, ready for assembly and user flows
