## WP24 Retrospective

### What Went Well
- Strong modularization of tools and LLM usage.
- Standardized prompt templates improved reusability.
- Schema enforcement via tool registry prevented runtime errors.
- Testing framework ensured reliability and regression control.

### What Could Be Improved
- Initial commits caused regressions due to unscoped changesâ€”need stricter scope discipline.
- More frequent integration testing would have surfaced interface mismatches earlier.
- Better tracking of which tools have updated schemas to streamline tool_catalog maintenance.

### Surprises
- Needed to refactor several tools to adopt LLM helper and prompt system.
- Prompt templating offered significant maintainability benefits beyond expectations.

### Next Time
- Enforce stricter change isolation in complex toolchains.
- Add test cases for each prompt YAML key during validation.
- Auto-generate tool_catalog/manifest entries from schemas.

### Shoutouts
- Great alignment with PoD engineering standards.
- Solid improvements in end-to-end drafting reliability and quality.
