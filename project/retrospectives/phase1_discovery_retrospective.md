## 🔍 Phase 1 Retrospective – Discovery (ProductPod)

---

### 🎯 What We Set Out to Do
Establish a solid foundation for an AI-native concussion recovery app, including:
- User needs, journeys, and GPT use cases
- App features and backend capabilities
- Medical knowledge graph design
- Integration with EHR (Epic), Azure, and wearables
- Delivery practices and ways of working

---

### ✅ Highlights & Wins
- **Ways of Working** defined and approved early — smoothed later delivery
- **Project Goals & App Flows** nailed product intent and real-world value
- **Feature Design** mapped to tools, users, journeys, and data
- **YAML-based Medical Graph** formalized domain logic using open formats
- **Spikes completed** for YAML reasoning, Epic FHIR, session memory, Power BI
- **Architecture mapped** across GPT, FastAPI, tools, dashboards, and storage
- **Backlog organized** for seamless transition into Build Phase

---

### 🔍 Lessons Learned
- GPT commit previews can be redacted — always verify before finalizing
- Early agreement on GPT's reasoning boundaries is critical (vs. backend logic)
- YAML logic works well when GPT reasons from full context vs. piecemeal tools
- Session handoff is a usability challenge; multiple fallback paths are needed
- Medical domain integration benefits from simple schemas and decision graphs

### 📦 Deliverables Completed
- `ways_of_working.md`
- `project_goals.md`
- `user_app_flows.md`
- `app_features.md`
- `system_architecture.md`
- YAMLs: `triage_map.yaml`, `stages.yaml`, `symptoms_*.yaml`
- Spikes: Epic, Power BI, YAML inference, session memory
- `build_phase_backlog.md`

### 🚀 Ready for Build Phase
Handoff prepared with clear structure, reference files, and process.
Thank you for the jam session!
