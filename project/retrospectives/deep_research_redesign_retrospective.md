# 🧠 Retrospective: Deep Research Redesign of PolicyGPT (May 19, 2025)

## 🌟 Summary

Over the course of this session, we completed a significant architectural and planning redesign for PolicyGPT based on the Deep Research capabilities required to support dynamic, traceable, and high-fidelity policy artifact generation for government project gating. The work focused on aligning system design, build planning, and user journeys with new capabilities like agentic planning, full reasoning trace capture, and multi-modal ingestion/feedback workflows.

---

## ✅ What Went Well

- **System Design Refinement**: We revised the system architecture to cleanly represent new capabilities including validator enforcement, memory modes, tool chaining, and reasoning trace capture.
- **Build Plan Clarity**: Each work package (WP1–WP10) was rewritten to include:
  - Outcomes, Scope, Tasks, Acceptance Criteria
  - Mapped design references with file paths and snippets
- **Journey Alignment**: Core user journeys (Structured Iteration, Fast Track, Review/Revise) were documented and explicitly mapped to supporting work packages.
- **Precision in Dependencies**: We documented clear dependencies across WPs, reducing ambiguity for parallelization and onboarding of new developers.
- **Catch-Up & Realignment**: We rehydrated key system context and corrected misalignments from older scaffolding drafts.

---

## 🧩 What Could Be Improved

- **Canvas Integration**: Initial formatting issues delayed collaborative structuring. Markdown pasting was awkward until we stabilized the format.
- **Rehydration Complexity**: Token/token-memory limits temporarily led to disconnection between earlier updates and design file alignment. A more formal `rehydrate_context()` mechanism would be helpful for future sessions.
- **Reference Links**: Manual effort was required to re-link design artifacts. Automated indexing of system design references could reduce overhead and errors.
- **Visibility of System State**: Some friction stemmed from not having real-time visibility into your local `canvas`, `docs/`, or `system_design/` state from this chat.

---

## 💡 Key Decisions

- Adopted `reasoning_trace.yaml` and `planner_task_trace.yaml` as central trace artifacts.
- Consolidated validator + drafting tools into shared rule-enforced pipeline.
- Split "Input Ingestion" (WP10) and "Feedback Ingestion" (WP9) to reflect their different roles.
- Created `gate_reference.yaml` and `reference_model.md` as foundational to planner and validator logic.
- Added detailed “Linked System Design Files” sections to all WPs.

---

## 📌 Action Items

- [ ] Finalize and commit updated `build_plan.md`, `system_architecture.md`, `acceptance_criteria.md`.
- [ ] Create `retrospectives/deep_research_redesign.md` and store this summary.
- [ ] Tag this phase as `Milestone: Phase 2 Kickoff Ready` in project tracker.
- [ ] Stand up WP1–WP3 as immediate build targets.

## 🏁 Closing Note

This redesign brings PolicyGPT closer to being a production-grade, auditable, and extensible copilot for public sector teams. The clarity gained from this deep research sprint will reduce development thrash and enhance confidence in delivery quality.

_It was a pleasure collaborating on this redesign. Onward!_
