## WP9 Retrospective: Ingestion Tools and Logging (May 21, 2025)

### üèÅ What Went Well
- We delivered a unified ingestion layer across three input types: text, file, and link.
- DB logging and YAML trace logging now ensure traceability for all inputs.
- Snapshot capture gives downstream tools a reliable memory starting point.
- Code reuse across tool types was high due to consistent structure_input payloads.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges
- **Tool/Runner Confusion**: Tools (like `uploadTextInput`) often duplicated logic already done in runners. This led to double-wrapping and overwriting key fields like `text`.
- **DB Schema Drift**: `PromptLog` had outdated fields, and changes were only discovered after runtime errors. Resetting DBs in dev and testing environments needs to be smoother.
- **pyodbc Errors**: Errors from SQL Server were verbose and unhelpful. These often masked the real root issue (e.g., wrong types or missing columns).

### üß† Lessons Learned
- Tools should expect already-processed input payloads when possible. Ingestion runners can own `structure_input` construction.
- Aligning DB schema with YAML payloads and in-code data structures should be a first-class task.
- Test tool CLI runners early to surface integration issues between ingestion ‚Üí logging ‚Üí DB.

### üí° Tips for Other Pods
- **Tool Templates**: Reuse the `Tool` base class and follow `run_tool()` and `validate()` hooks.
- **Logging**: Use `log_tool_usage(...)` consistently and structure input summaries to be readable (e.g., `source | type`).
- **Testing**: Add `test_inputs` folder with small examples. Build a CLI runner to test ingestion end-to-end before writing full pipeline tests.
- **DB Debugging**: Use `sqlalchemy.inspect` and SQL shell to confirm schema migrations took effect.
