# Task 1.5 Retrospective ‚Äì Research Spikes: Concussion Recovery Knowledge Graph

## Task Summary
**Mission:** Develop a structured, clinically grounded knowledge graph to support triage, symptom tracking, and recovery guidance in the Concussion GPT app.

**Outputs Delivered:**
- `reference/stages.yaml` ‚Äì Defines recovery stages, progression rules, and clinical safeguards
- `reference/symptoms_*.yaml` ‚Äì Modular files detailing symptom metadata across physical, cognitive, emotional, sleep, and red flag domains
- `reference/triage_map.yaml` ‚Äì Structured triage flow with GPT-friendly parsing, symptom mapping, and escalation logic
- `reference/medical_graph_summary.md` ‚Äì Overview and implementation guide for the full knowledge graph

## What Worked Well ‚úÖ
- **Clear Scope & Input Context**: The ProductPod provided well-scoped prompts and helpful background files
- **Clinically Aligned Enhancements**: Referenced SCAT6, CDC HEADS UP, and literature to refine stages and red flag definitions
- **Tool-Friendly Schema**: Structured YAML for GPT ingestion, with fields like `response_parsing`, `symptom_links`, `tool_tags`
- **Modularization**: Breaking `symptoms.yaml` into category-specific files improved editability, performance, and tool targeting
- **Conversation-Centric Design**: Prioritized natural GPT flow while preserving clinical guardrails

## What Could Be Improved üîç
- **YAML Preview Size Limits**: Needed to split `symptoms.yaml` due to size constraints, which added operational steps
- **SCAT6 Structure Complexity**: Condensing nuanced recovery progression into stages required multiple review cycles
- **Upstream Tool Coordination**: Would benefit from closer coordination with parsing/memory logic teams earlier

## Lessons for Future Tasks üí°
- Maintain modularity for large YAML sets
- Use `tool_tags` and `example_user_utterances` early in schema design
- Embed red flag logic natively in both symptom and triage graphs

## Final Recommendation ‚úÖ
The structure and content of this knowledge graph are ready for integration with GPT agents, parsing tools, memory, and user-facing UI. It provides a solid semantic base for the broader Concussion GPT system.
