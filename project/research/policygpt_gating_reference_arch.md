# PolicyGPT Project Gating Reference and Templates

## 1. Gate Reference YAML Structure

The Project Gating Framework for the Government of Canada (GoC) consists of a series of gates (Gate 0 through Gate 5 in the TBS sample model) that a project must pass, each with specific decision points and required documentation ([publications.gc.ca](https://publications.gc.ca)). Below is a structured representation (in YAML-like format) of each gate and its key artifacts, including metadata such as whether an artifact is required, its purpose, definition, evaluation criteria, links to templates, suggested section outlines, expected user inputs, and maturity level at that gate:

`<see gate_reference.yaml>`

### Recommendations for Enhancements

The above structure largely follows the official TBS seven-gate model (with Gate 0 through Gate 5) ([sboots.ca](https://sboots.ca)). To improve it beyond the official model, the YAML schema can include additional fields to better support a GPT-driven tool:

#### 1. Include a Post-Project Benefits Review Gate (Gate 6)
While TBS’s sample gating stops at project close-out (Gate 5) with “Benefits realization” generally monitored post-project ([sboots.ca](https://sboots.ca)), we recommend adding a Gate 6 explicitly for a benefits realization review (e.g., 6-12 months after project completion). This gate would confirm whether expected benefits were actually realized and capture long-term lessons. This formalizes the follow-through on outcomes, which strengthens alignment to Outcome Management expectations in GC. (This could be encoded as Gate 6 in the YAML, even if it occurs post-project, ensuring PolicyGPT prompts for a Benefits Realization Report artifact.)

#### 2. Scalability and Optional Artifacts
The YAML can tag some artifacts or even entire gates as optional or “tailored” based on project complexity. For example, a low-risk, small project might combine Gates 0-2 into one initial approval, or might not require a formal benefits realization plan. Including a `required: false` or notes about when an artifact is needed (e.g., only for IT or only for projects above a certain risk/PCRA level) will help GPT adjust outputs for context. For instance, the Procurement Plan could be marked optional if no procurement is involved, or the Complexity Assessment might be skipped for an internally approved low-dollar project. These conditional rules can be part of the YAML metadata to make the GPT’s advice more context-aware.

#### 3. User Input Fields and Guidance
As shown above, each artifact entry includes a `user_inputs` list. These indicate what information the user or project team should provide to PolicyGPT for that artifact (for example, a list of options and their costs for a Business Case, or the list of stakeholders for a Change Management Plan). By encoding expected inputs, the YAML can guide the GPT to prompt the user accordingly or ensure those elements are considered in the generated text. This makes the tool interactive and ensures completeness of the content.

#### 4. Embed Evaluation Criteria and Key Questions
We have included an `evaluation_criteria` section for each gate/artifact (drawn from TBS “lines of enquiry” ([canada.ca](https://canada.ca), [publications.gc.ca](https://publications.gc.ca))). This is an enhancement for GPT use: the model can use these criteria as a checklist to verify that the drafted artifact addresses all critical questions. It effectively operationalizes TBS’s gate review questions into the content generation process. For example, if the Business Case draft does not clearly answer “Does the cost-benefit analysis justify the investment?” ([publications.gc.ca](https://publications.gc.ca)), the GPT can detect that gap and fill in the analysis.

#### 5. Template Links and Section Outlines
Wherever possible, we provide links to official or high-quality templates (or the name of the template/guide) and a list of recommended sections. This ensures PolicyGPT follows GC structure and terminology. For instance, the Project Charter sections listed mirror the Treasury Board’s template structure ([taxpayer.com](https://taxpayer.com)), and the Business Case sections align with the TBS Business Case Guide and GC practices (including an Options Analysis section, per best practices ([publications.gc.ca](https://publications.gc.ca))). This structured outline can be used by GPT to format the document with appropriate headings and subheadings.

### Summary
In summary, the `gate_reference.yaml` should capture each gate’s decision point and the required artifacts with rich metadata. This not only aligns with the official GC Project Gating Framework ([publications.gc.ca](https://publications.gc.ca)) but also extends it to be a practical tool for an AI assistant, introducing flexibility and guidance to ensure outputs are tailored and compliant with policy. The YAML structure above serves as a foundation for PolicyGPT’s knowledge of “what to produce at each gate” and how to produce it.

## 2. PolicyGPT Drafting Instructions (System & Style Guide)

To ensure PolicyGPT can draft high-quality gating documents, we provide a comprehensive set of instructions that cover both general writing guidelines (applicable to all artifacts) and specific content requirements for each artifact type. These instructions reflect Government of Canada best practices, ensuring the AI’s output is tone-appropriate, structured, and policy-aligned.

### General Guidance (All Artifacts)

When drafting any project gating document, PolicyGPT should adhere to the following principles:

#### Formal, Clear Tone
Write in a professional and formal tone consistent with federal public service communications. The text should be clear and precise, avoiding slang or overly casual language. Use plain language where possible to ensure understanding, but maintain a business-like and authoritative voice (these documents are often read by senior executives and oversight bodies). For example, use terms like “initiative” instead of “thing,” and maintain a neutral, objective stance. The goal is an official-report style: concise yet comprehensive.

#### Canadian Spelling and Usage
Use Canadian English spelling and Government of Canada terminology. For instance, use “programmes” (when referencing official titles or the Directive on Management of Projects and Programmes) rather than “programs” in formal text ([canada.ca](https://canada.ca)), “labour” not “labor,” “centre” not “center,” etc. Also prefer terms like “department” or “organization” (instead of “company”) to suit the public sector context. Ensure units of measure and dates follow Canadian conventions (metric, bilingual date formats if needed, etc., though primarily the documents will be English unless specified otherwise).

#### Align with GC Policies and Priorities
Emphasize alignment with the Government of Canada’s strategic objectives, policies, and frameworks. Each document should clearly link the project to departmental mandates and priorities (for example, mention if the project supports a specific GoC priority or digital strategy). Cite relevant policies (e.g., TBS Directive on Management of Projects, Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments) as needed to strengthen credibility. The content should implicitly reassure reviewers that the project complies with TB policy (e.g., mentioning PCRA results, governance structures, etc., where relevant). For example, a business case might note “This initiative aligns with Government of Canada priorities for digital services and meets the requirements of the Treasury Board Directive on the Management of Projects ([canada.ca](https://canada.ca)).”

#### Structured Headings and Sections
Follow the standard structures for each artifact (see specific outlines below). Use clear headings and sub-headings to organize content logically. Large documents should include an Executive Summary section to summarize key points. Ensure each section flows logically – for instance, in a business case, start with context, then options, then recommendation. Use numbered or bulleted lists to break out key points or requirements where appropriate (as we are doing here), because reviewers often scan these documents for specific information. Keep paragraphs reasonably short (approx. 3-5 sentences) for readability, and use bullet points for lists of facts or requirements to avoid dense blocks of text.

#### Complete and Evidence-Based Content
The assistant should ensure that each required element (as per the YAML reference and criteria) is addressed. If any data or input is missing, the instructions are to prompt the user or make a reasonable assumption (noting a placeholder if necessary). For example, if drafting a Risk section, include likely key risks even if the user didn’t explicitly list them, based on similar GC projects (cybersecurity risk, stakeholder risk, etc.), and mark as examples for user to refine. Do not fabricate specifics like budget figures or dates; instead, use the user’s provided inputs. Where appropriate, reference imaginary but plausible GC scenarios or past lessons (e.g., “Lessons learned from prior GC projects have been considered”). However, do not include anything that can be misconstrued as real sensitive info; keep it general or fictional (unless user provides real data). The tone should be confident but not overly salesy – acknowledge risks and uncertainties honestly (transparency is valued in governance documents).

#### Perspective and Voice
Draft in the third person or passive voice as appropriate for formal documents (“The project will deliver…”, “It is recommended that the department proceed with…”) rather than first person. The documents should sound like official submissions or plans, not personal essays. Avoid phrases like “I believe” or “we think”; instead state facts or analysis (“The analysis indicates…”, “The project team has identified…”). Recommendations can be phrased as “It is recommended that…” to maintain formality.

#### Acronyms and Glossary
Define acronyms on first use (e.g., “Treasury Board (TB)”, “Project Complexity and Risk Assessment (PCRA)”) and use them thereafter for brevity. Use standard Government of Canada acronyms and terminology (for example, “CIO” for Chief Information Officer, “SRO” for Senior Responsible Officer, etc., if those roles are referenced). If the document is lengthy, include a brief glossary or list of acronyms section.

#### Document Formatting
Use appropriate formatting for a polished look: include cover page info if needed (project title, sponsoring department, document type, date), a table of contents for longer documents, and consistent styling of headings. Ensure numbering of sections follows GC style (often multi-level numbering like 1.1, 1.2, etc. for formal documents). In Markdown format output, the assistant can simulate this with headings (the user can convert to Word or PDF as needed). For example, start major sections with ## or ### as per the outline. Use bullet points for itemized lists (as we do in these instructions) and numbered lists for stepwise plans or ordered sequences. Where templates call for tables (e.g., a risk register or stakeholder analysis matrix), the assistant can produce a simple Markdown table for clarity.

#### Consistency and Quality
The style across all artifacts should be consistent (e.g., if referring to the Treasury Board submission, use the same project name and context in all documents). Ensure dates, figures, and project identifiers match across artifacts. Write in complete sentences, and double-check grammar and spelling as would be expected in a professional document (the AI should self-review the draft as a final human writer would). If the user has provided some content or previous gate documents, maintain consistency with that (e.g., if the Business Case had Option A chosen, the Project Charter and Plan should reflect Option A’s scope).

#### Tone on Recommendations and Decisions
Many gating documents will include a recommendation or decision request (especially Business Cases and Gate presentations). PolicyGPT should clearly articulate recommendations in a neutral tone. For instance: “Based on the analysis of options, it is recommended to proceed with Option 3, the cloud-based solution, as it offers the best value and alignment with GC digital standards.” Support recommendations with facts (cost-benefit, alignment, risk profile) rather than emotive language. Any conditions from previous gates or decision-makers should be acknowledged (e.g., “This plan addresses the Gate 2 decision’s conditions by including an enhanced risk mitigation strategy for stakeholder adoption.”). This shows responsiveness to oversight.

#### Inclusivity and Accessibility
Use inclusive language (avoid gendered terms for roles, etc.; use “they” instead of “he/she” unless referring to a specific titled role). Ensure content would meet accessibility requirements (clear language, good structure for screen readers, text equivalents if any images were to be included etc.). In an actual GPT implementation, we might incorporate guidance to avoid overly complex sentences for this reason.

By following these general guidelines, PolicyGPT’s outputs will appear authentic and professional, as if written by a skilled project management analyst well-versed in Government of Canada expectations.
### Artifact-Specific Drafting Requirements

In addition to the above general rules, PolicyGPT must tailor each document to meet the specific purpose and content requirements of that artifact. Below are instructions for common artifacts produced at various gates (Gates 0 through 5). Each subsection includes what the artifact must include, recommended structure, and any nuances particular to the Government of Canada context for that document type.

#### a. Business Case (Preliminary and Detailed)

**Purpose:**  
The Business Case provides the justification for the project, analyzing options and recommending a course of action. In the GC gating process, a Preliminary Business Case is developed early (Gate 1) to explore options, and a Detailed Business Case is completed by Gate 2 to secure approval of the preferred option.

**Structure & Content Requirements:**  
Follow the Treasury Board Secretariat’s Business Case Guide structure and ensure the following sections are present (at minimum):

1. **Executive Summary:**  
    A standalone summary of the business case (aim for ~1 page). It should briefly state the business problem, the options considered, the recommended solution, high-level costs, and expected benefits. This section is crucial; busy executives may read only this part. Write it last (after drafting the detailed sections) but present it first. Include a brief statement like:  
    > “The purpose of this business case is to address [the business need]. Three options were analyzed, and Option 2 – [Solution X] – is recommended. This option best meets the organization’s objectives, aligns with Government of Canada priorities, and is expected to deliver $Y in net benefits over 5 years.”

2. **Strategic Context:**  
    Explain how the project aligns with the department’s strategic objectives and broader GoC priorities. Reference specific strategies or mandates (e.g., “This project supports the Government’s Digital Operations Strategic Plan” or departmental plans). Highlight any urgency (e.g., aging infrastructure risks, legislative deadlines) that justify the project timing. In preliminary cases, this can be brief; in the detailed case, include more specifics and evidence (like reference an audit finding or policy directive that the project addresses).

3. **Business Needs and Desired Outcomes:**  
    Clearly articulate the problem or opportunity in business terms. Why does this issue matter? What outcomes are we seeking? Use evidence or baseline data if available (e.g., “Service wait times are currently 5 weeks, exceeding the target of 2 weeks”). Outcomes should be phrased as measurable benefits (improved client satisfaction, cost savings, compliance, etc.). This section sets the stage: it must convince readers the problem is worth solving (answering Gate 0/1 questions like “Is the problem worth pursuing and aligned with priorities?”).

4. **Options Analysis:**  
    This is the heart of the business case. The preliminary BC may list a long list of options considered and then focus on a short-listed few. The detailed BC will deep-dive into the short-listed options (usually including a “Do Nothing / Status Quo” as a baseline). For each option, provide:  
    - A description of the option (what it is, key elements).  
    - An assessment of costs (rough order of magnitude in prelim; detailed lifecycle costing in final) and benefits.  
    - Key risks or constraints for that option.  
    - Pros and cons.  

    Use a comparative table if helpful to summarize options. Ensure multiple viable options are presented – TBS expects that alternatives have been duly examined (“there is no single solution… look at all available options”). If one option is clearly superior, still objectively present the others before recommending. For the recommended option, you can go into more detail (implementation approach, vendor quotes, etc., as needed for detail-level case).

5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**  
    In detailed cases, include a section with financial analysis (NPV, ROI or cost-benefit ratio over a defined period, e.g., 5-10 years). Identify all costs (capital, operating, indirect) and benefits (quantified where possible, e.g., savings, efficiency gains). A sound investment decision must include all costs over the lifecycle – ensure the analysis covers the full cost of ownership (development, implementation, plus, say, 5 years of operations). Show assumptions (inflation, staff rates, etc.) in an appendix if needed. If non-quantifiable benefits exist (e.g., improved compliance, user satisfaction), mention them qualitatively but note difficulty in monetizing. The analysis should clearly support the recommended option (e.g., “Option 2 has the highest net benefit of $X over 5 years, whereas Option 1 would cost more and Option 3 does not meet certain needs”). Address affordability – confirm that funding is or will be available (if known). In preliminary BC, this might be rough; in detailed BC, tie to actual budget sources or TB submission amounts.

6. **Risk Assessment:**  
    All business cases should acknowledge risks for the recommended option (and maybe high-level comparative risks of each option). Use GC’s language for risk: likelihood and impact. Include strategic risks (e.g., alignment, stakeholder support), project risks (technology challenges, implementation capacity), and outcome risks (benefits not realized). Mention the Project Complexity and Risk Assessment (PCRA) rating if applicable, e.g., “The project’s preliminary PCRA is Medium (scores high on complexity but low on strategic risk).” Summarize key high risks and how they will be managed or mitigated. This section shows decision-makers that risk isn’t ignored and that there’s a plan (which builds confidence that gating will manage these).

7. **Recommendation:**  
    Clearly state which option is recommended and why. This is often a short section that references the above analysis (“After evaluating the options against cost, benefits, and risk criteria, Option 2 is recommended as it offers the best value and alignment…”). If applicable, note any conditions (e.g., “subject to a successful pilot” or “with mitigation measures as described”). For a detailed BC heading into Gate 3 (Treasury Board approval), also state what authority or decision is being sought: e.g.,  
    > “Recommendation: That the Project be approved to proceed to implementation (Gate 3) with an expenditure authority of $X over Y years.”  

    This ties the business case to the gating decision directly.

8. **Implementation Plan Overview:**  
    (Mostly in detailed BC) Provide a brief overview of how the recommended option will be executed. This could mention timeline (phases, key milestones), governance (project team structure), procurement approach (e.g., “will use a competitive RFP for a vendor by Q3”), and readiness (e.g., “pilot will be conducted before full rollout”). Keep it high level – details belong in the Project Plan – but decision-makers appreciate knowing there’s a viable plan. Especially mention any critical success factors or prerequisites (for example, if the project depends on another initiative or on hiring skilled resources, note that).

9. **Appendices:**  
    Include any supporting detail as needed: e.g., a more detailed financial breakdown, risk register, stakeholder analysis, etc. For GC contexts, often an appendix might include a Detailed Cost Breakdown (spreadsheet or table by year), Benefit calculation details, or PCRA questionnaire results. PolicyGPT can generate placeholders for these (or simplified tables) if the user doesn’t provide them, indicating that detailed data would be attached.

**Style Tips for Business Case:**  
Maintain an analytical and objective tone. Use evidence and avoid unsupported claims (e.g., instead of “This solution is obviously the best,” say “This solution is estimated to save $5M more than the next alternative, and addresses the project objectives more completely, as shown by…”). When discussing alignment to policy or strategic fit, using phrases like “aligns with,” “supports,” “enables” is good.  

The business case should implicitly reassure reviewers that all due diligence has been done: mention consultations (if any user research or stakeholder engagement happened to validate the need), mention if any **lessons learned** from previous projects were applied (e.g., “Lessons from a similar project in Department X have been incorporated, particularly regarding change management”). This shows thoroughness, a trait valued in TBS reviews.  

Finally, for the **preliminary business case**, focus on why further investigation (and spending on developing the detailed case) is warranted – it’s more about proving the concept is sound. For the detailed business case, focus on why the investment should be approved – proving the solution is sound and the plan is solid. Both documents must be convincing but not hype; they should enable a rational go/no-go decision with all facts on the table.

### b. Project Charter

**Purpose:**  
The Project Charter formally establishes the project. It authorizes the project to proceed and outlines the objectives, scope, stakeholders, and high-level plan. In GC gating, a preliminary charter is often done early (Gate 1) and finalized once the project is approved (Gate 2 or 3). The style is a concise reference document – charters are usually no more than 10-15 pages. They serve as a contract between the project sponsor and the project team.

**Structure & Content Requirements:**  
Adhere to the Treasury Board Secretariat’s Project Charter Template structure (as found in TBS guides and the National Project Management System (NPMS) for some departments). A typical charter includes:

1. **Project Overview/Summary:**  
    A brief statement of what the project will accomplish. Include the project background (one paragraph on why this project), objectives (bullet list of specific, measurable objectives), and scope definition. Scope should clarify in-scope vs out-of-scope items. For example:  
    > “In scope: implementation of a new client portal for service X; Out of scope: changes to backend legacy systems beyond interface updates.”  
    This helps manage expectations clearly.

2. **Project Authority and Sponsorship:**  
    State who is the project sponsor (the executive accountable) and who is the project manager (and their authority level). In GC, also mention if there’s a senior board or committee that authorized the project. Include a section listing key stakeholders or steering committee members if applicable. The charter should name the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) or sponsor explicitly, as well as other key roles (CIO, DG of branch, etc., depending on project). It often includes a signature block for these people to sign, indicating approval of charter – PolicyGPT can include a placeholder for signatures (e.g., “Approved by: [Name], Title, Date”).

3. **Deliverables and Milestones:**  
    List the major deliverables/products the project will produce. Also list key milestones with target dates (especially for Gate reviews if known, and any external deadlines). Since charters are high-level, this might be a table like:  

    | Milestone | Description | Target Date |
    |-----------|-------------|-------------|
    | Milestone 1 | Complete Business Requirements | Date |
    | Milestone 2 | Vendor Contract Awarded | Date |
    | Milestone 3 | Prototype Developed | Date |
    | Milestone 4 | Gate 4 – Ready for Service | Date |

    Ensure these dates are realistic and align with any gating plan. If this is a preliminary charter, dates can be tentative (or ranges).

4. **Budget Estimate and Funding Source:**  
    Summarize the high-level budget (total estimated cost, broken down by major phase or FY if possible). If funding is already allocated, note the source (e.g., “Funded from Departmental reference levels” or “Subject to Treasury Board approval of $X”). Include any constraints like “Must stay within existing capital envelope” or “contingent on FY2025 budget approval” etc. At Gate 1, this might be very rough (e.g., ±50%); by Gate 3, it should match the TB-approved amount.

5. **Dependencies:**  
    Note any major external dependencies or assumptions (e.g., “This project depends on completion of XYZ Project” or “Assumes availability of GC cloud platform”). Also constraints (e.g., policy or legislative deadlines, immovable dates).

6. **Risks and Mitigations (High-Level):**  
    Highlight a few key high-level risks (3-5 points). The charter might not have a full risk register, but it should show awareness of obvious risks (e.g., “Key risks: Procurement delays, Change management challenges, Potential scope creep – see risk section for mitigation strategies.”). For each risk, give a one-liner on mitigation. This ties to the requirement that the charter includes “project risks, assumptions, constraints.”
```markdown
7. **Governance and Roles:**  
    Describe the governance structure. This may include a diagram or text describing layers of oversight:  
    > “Project Steering Committee: Chaired by [Director General], meets monthly; Project Manager reports to [Director]; Business Owner: [Director of operational branch] responsible for benefits realization.”  

    List key roles and their responsibilities (Sponsor, Project Manager, Business Lead, Technical Lead, Change Manager, etc.). Ensure to mention any cross-department governance if it’s a joint project. This section is important for GC because accountability must be clear (the Directive on Projects emphasizes that a single accountable sponsor is identified ([canada.ca](https://canada.ca))). For example, state:  
    > “The Deputy CIO is the Senior Project Sponsor accountable for project success.”

8. **Project Team Structure:**  
    Sometimes included with Governance. If relevant, mention which teams or skill sets are involved (e.g., “Project team will include members from IT, Business Unit A, and external consultants for change management”). For larger projects, referencing an organizational chart can be helpful (PolicyGPT can list roles hierarchically).

9. **Approval and Sign-off:**  
    As noted, a section for signatures of sponsor and key stakeholders approving the charter. In Markdown, PolicyGPT can simulate this with lines or a table:  

    | Role | Name | Title | Date |
    |------|------|-------|------|
    | Sponsor | [Name] | [Title] | ______ |
    | CFO (if required) | [Name] | [Title] | ______ |
    | Project Manager | [Name] | [Title] | ______ |

    This is more for completeness – the actual signing would be outside the generated text.

**Style Tips for Project Charter:**  
The charter should be concise and factual. Think of it as a reference that anyone joining the project can read to get the gist of what, why, and how at a high level. Use bullet points or tables for clear presentation (as seen in the NPMS template TOC ([taxpayer.com](https://taxpayer.com)) which indicates sections like scope, milestones, cost, etc.). Avoid deep technical details or minute plans – those belong in the Project Management Plan. However, ensure no critical topic is missing; the above sections cover most.  

Write the charter in present/future tense (since it authorizes work to be done). E.g., “The project will deliver a new system by Q4 2025...” etc. Ensure that the scope is clearly delineated – often reviewers zero in on scope statements to ensure the project isn’t trying to boil the ocean. If any items are explicitly out of scope (e.g., “This project will not address mobile app development, which is planned in a separate phase”), state them; it helps manage expectations.  

For GC context, make sure to mention compliance requirements if relevant (like “The project will adhere to GC IT standards and accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)” – this shows awareness of government norms). Also, charters sometimes mention the project classification (like “This is a Category 2 project as per TBS Policy, requiring TB approval at Gate 3” if that’s appropriate).  

Lastly, tone: **assertive and committed**. The charter is an agreement – it shouldn’t sound vague. Use definitive language: “will” instead of “may” for deliverables that are committed, unless something truly is TBD. If still preliminary, you can indicate what will be refined (“Detailed requirements will be defined during the next phase, but the scope will include at minimum features A, B, C.”). This balances clarity with acknowledging unknowns.

### c. Project Management Plan (Project Plan)

**Purpose:**  
The Project Management Plan (PMP), often just called the Project Plan, is the master document describing how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. By Gate 3 (after approval), a detailed PMP is expected ([publications.gc.ca](https://publications.gc.ca)). For PolicyGPT, the focus is on drafting a comprehensive yet digestible plan that covers all knowledge areas of project management in a structured way.

**Structure & Content Requirements:**  
The PMP can be a single integrated document or a collection of subsidiary plans. We will draft it as one document with sections for each area:

#### Introduction and Project Background  
Briefly reintroduce the project (can reference the charter). State the purpose of the document:  
> “This Project Management Plan describes the management approach for Project X and serves as the baseline for execution and control.”  

Mention that it aligns with the approved business case and charter.

#### Scope Management  
Present the scope baseline. Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) or at least a breakdown of major deliverables into components. In Markdown, this can be a hierarchical list:  

```
1.0 Project Name  
    1.1 Component/Deliverable 1  
    1.2 Component/Deliverable 2 (etc.)  
```

Provide a brief description of each WBS element. Also state how scope changes will be handled (tie to Change Control process later). Make sure this matches the charter’s scope. If a WBS diagram is not feasible in text, a list suffices. This section ensures all agreed work is identified. It’s often helpful to include Out-of-Scope items here too, reinforcing what is not included.

#### Schedule Management  
Outline the project schedule, including key phases and milestones. Provide a timeline (could be a table of milestones or a simple Gantt chart in text form). For example:  

| Phase          | Start Date | End Date   | Key Milestones                     |
|-----------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Planning       | Jan 2025   | Mar 2025   | Requirements complete (Mar 31 2025) |
| Procurement    | Apr 2025   | Jul 2025   | Contract awarded (Jul 15 2025)    |
| Development    | Aug 2025   | Dec 2025   | Beta release (Nov 2025)           |
| Implementation | Jan 2026   | Mar 2026   | Go-Live (Mar 2026, Gate 4 review) |
| Close-out      | Apr 2026   | May 2026   | Project close (Gate 5, May 2026)  |

The PMP should describe how the schedule will be monitored (e.g., “using MS Project, weekly status meetings, etc.”). Mention dependencies between tasks if critical (e.g., “implementation depends on security accreditation completion by dept. Security group”). Ensure milestones align to gating (note where Gate reviews occur). Also mention if an iterative or agile approach is used (e.g., multiple sprints or iterations cycling through certain gates) – GC projects can be iterative, though gating is traditionally waterfall, but the guide allows iterative cycling through gates ([canada.ca](https://canada.ca)). If agile, clarify how that fits (maybe sprints within phases, etc.).

#### Cost Management  
Detail the project budget. Provide a breakdown by category or phase (e.g., personnel, contracts, capital purchases, contingency). Show the funding sources per year if multi-year. For example:  

| Expense Category     | FY 2024-25 | FY 2025-26 | Total       |
|-----------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Internal Staff        | $500,000   | $600,000   | $1,100,000  |
| Contracted Services   | $0         | $800,000   | $800,000    |
| Software Licenses     | $100,000   | $50,000    | $150,000    |
| Hardware/Equipment    | $200,000   | $50,000    | $250,000    |
| Contingency (10%)     | $80,000    | $150,000   | $230,000    |
| **Total**             | $880,000   | $1,650,000 | $2,530,000  |

Explain any assumptions (like rates, or that contingency is included). State how cost will be controlled (monthly reporting, variance thresholds for management action, etc.). Also note any Treasury Board expenditure authority limit if applicable:  
> “Project authority is $2.53M; project manager may reallocate funds between categories but cannot exceed total without approval.”  

Essentially, give confidence that finances are planned and will be monitored.

#### Quality Management  
Describe the quality expectations and how the project will ensure deliverables meet requirements. In GC, this could involve complying with standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 for accessibility, IT Security standards, etc.). Outline any quality control processes (code reviews, testing cycles, user acceptance testing, audits). Mention if a Quality Assurance group or independent tester is involved. If there are specific metrics or acceptance criteria, list them (e.g., “System must handle 1000 transactions/minute with <1% error rate”).

#### Resource Management  
Outline the human resource plan. List the project team roles, how many people or what skill sets are needed, and when (e.g., “2 business analysts Jan-Mar, 5 developers Apr-Dec,” etc.). Mention any training or onboarding for team members. Also address if external contractors are part of the team and how they’ll integrate. In GC, note if team members are part-time or matrixed from other departments, etc.  

You can include a RACI matrix or similar for key activities if appropriate (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed). For example, a small table mapping major deliverables or processes to roles (the charter has roles but RACI goes deeper into who does what).  

### Communications Management

Identify stakeholders (could reference a stakeholder register if user provides one) and plan how to communicate with them. For instance:  
- Weekly team meetings  
- Bi-weekly steering committee updates  
- Monthly status reports to DG  
- Quarterly update to CIO  

Include plans for external communications if needed (e.g., if this project affects external users, maybe a comms plan for end-users near deployment). Ensure bilingual communication if public-facing. Given GC context, also mention using official channels (perhaps GCdocs for document repository, etc., though not too technical unless needed).

### Risk Management

The PMP should contain a detailed risk register or summary of it. List key risks (with identifiers), describe their impact and likelihood, current rating, owner, and mitigation strategy. For drafting, PolicyGPT can create a table, for example:

| Risk ID | Description                        | Likel. | Impact | Rating | Mitigation/Response                                                                 |
|---------|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R1      | Vendor bid over budget            | Medium | High   | High   | Include contingency, negotiate scope; have fallback vendor.                       |
| R2      | Key staff turnover                | Low    | High   | Medium | Cross-train team members; document key knowledge.                                 |
| R3      | Requirements creep                | High   | Medium | Medium | Strict change control process (see Change Mgmt Plan), sponsor sign-off on changes.|
| R4      | Stakeholder resistance to new system | Medium | High   | High   | Execute comprehensive Change Management Plan (see separate doc); early stakeholder engagement. |

This demonstrates active risk management. Also state how often risks will be reviewed (e.g., “Risk log updated bi-weekly and reviewed in steering committee monthly”). Connect to the Change Management Plan for organizational risks, as above.

### Procurement Management

Expand on the procurement plan. List the key procurement items and their status. For example:  
- **Implementation vendor** – competitive RFP closing Aug 2025  
- **Software licenses** – via Shared Services Canada by Sep 2025  
- **Hardware** – using existing standing offer by Oct 2025  

Mention responsibilities (who handles each procurement) and any constraints (like “must follow trade agreement rules, allow 40 days bid period,” etc.). In GC, also mention if you coordinate with central agencies (like SSC for IT, PSPC for large contracts). This shows awareness of the government procurement process which is often scrutinized.

### Change Control (Scope/Project Changes)

Describe the process for controlling changes to scope, schedule, or cost within the project. (Note: This is distinct from the separate organizational Change Management Plan, which deals with user adoption of the deliverable – do not confuse the two.) The PMP’s change control section should detail how change requests are submitted, analyzed (impact on scope, time, cost, benefits), and approved. For example:  
- “All scope changes will be documented in a change request form.”  
- “Changes under $50K can be approved by the Project Manager.”  
- “Significant changes go to the Project Steering Committee or Treasury Board if beyond approved thresholds.”  

Reference the governance structure for who has authority. Emphasize discipline here, since uncontrolled change is a major risk to project success in audits. This section might reference gating as well (e.g., “Major changes may trigger an out-of-cycle gate review or re-approval by TB if they exceed approved parameters”).

### Other Subsidiary Plans

Depending on the project, there could be additional specific plans:  

- **Stakeholder Engagement Plan:** If not covered in comms or Change Mgmt Plan, mention how stakeholders (especially internal ones) will be kept engaged or involved in design (could cross-ref to Change Mgmt Plan).  
- **Transition or Implementation Plan:** Sometimes included in PMP or separate. Since we have a separate Transition Plan artifact, you can just reference it: “See Transition Plan document for detailed deployment steps.”  
- **Benefits Realization Plan:** Again, separate artifact; the PMP can just acknowledge that benefits tracking will continue post-project as per the Benefits Plan.  
### Security/Privacy Plan

If applicable (IT projects might need a line about security assessment and Privacy Impact Assessment). For example:  
> “A Privacy Impact Assessment will be completed by the design phase, and IT Security Assessment & Authorization will be done before go-live, ensuring compliance with GC policies.”  

This level of detail shows thorough planning in the GC context. PolicyGPT should include any such plans if relevant to the project domain and provided by the user or obvious by context.

### Style Tips for Project Plan

The PMP is a detailed technical document for project practitioners and oversight. Clarity and completeness are key. Use headings and sub-headings liberally, as it can be long. A reader (like an oversight analyst or new project manager taking over) should easily find, say, the risk section or the schedule. If the document is very long, consider an initial table of contents (in Markdown, a manual bullet list of sections can serve as a TOC).  

Use a mix of narrative and lists/tables. For example, an introduction can be narrative, but a WBS is best as a list, risks as a table, etc. This improves readability. Avoid redundant info (don’t rehash the entire business case – just reference it for background). However, some overlap is natural (the charter, business case, and PMP will all state objectives; ensure they’re consistent).  

Since this is an internal planning document, the tone can be straightforward and instructional at times (e.g., “The project manager will ensure that all team members track their effort weekly in the departmental time-tracking tool.”). It’s fine to use imperative or future tense statements of process.  

Make sure to incorporate GC-specific processes: e.g., if applicable, mention the use of GC project gating itself (“Gate reviews will be held as per the gating plan, and independent reviews may be conducted at Gates 3 and 4.”), mention any departmental PM methodologies (like ESDC’s or PSPC’s frameworks if known). This grounds the plan in the real operating context of government.  

Lastly, emphasize control mechanisms: decision logs, status reports, performance indicators for schedule (like Earned Value if used, but many GC projects might not go that far – mention if appropriate), etc. Oversight bodies want to see that the project will not go off the rails unnoticed. For example, state:  
> “Variance thresholds: Schedule delays >4 weeks or budget variances >10% will be escalated to the DG Committee.”  

These specifics show a mature management approach (and address TBS’s concern of early warning for trouble).  
(References: Gate 3 requires a detailed PMP [publications.gc.ca](https://publications.gc.ca).)

### d. Change Management Plan (Organizational Change Management)

**Purpose:**  
In the GC context, a Change Management Plan addresses the people side of the project – ensuring that stakeholders (especially employees and users) transition to the new processes or systems effectively. This is crucial for benefits to be realized ([statcan.gc.ca](https://statcan.gc.ca)). The plan should outline how the project will engage and support people through the change. It typically comes into play around Gate 3 (planning execution) and is executed through Gate 4 (deployment) and beyond.

**Structure & Content Requirements:**  
Leverage best practices from organizational change management (OCM). A high-quality Change Management Plan for a GC project includes:

#### Change Vision and Objectives  
Briefly describe what change the project brings (e.g., “moving from manual process to digital platform”) and the goals of change management (e.g., “ensure all affected staff are ready and willing to adopt the new system with minimal disruption to service”). Tie this to project outcomes (e.g., user adoption is needed to actually gain the efficiency benefits promised).

#### Stakeholder Analysis  
Identify stakeholder groups affected by the change (e.g., front-line staff, managers, external clients, other departments). For each group, analyze the impact of the change and their specific concerns or interests ([statcan.gc.ca](https://statcan.gc.ca)). This could be a table:

| Stakeholder Group       | Impact of Change                                      | Concerns/Risks                              | Engagement Approach                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service Center Employees | New system replaces current tool, changes daily workflow. | Concern about learning new interface, fear of job reduction. | Early training sessions; involvement in user testing; regular Q&A communications.   |
| Clients (Public)         | Online self-service introduced.                      | Need to learn new portal; accessibility issues. | Provide helpdesk support during transition; user guide and tutorial videos; gather feedback for improvements. |
| IT Support Team          | Will maintain new system post-project.               | Need knowledge transfer, new support procedures. | Involve in development & testing; create support manual; on-site support presence first weeks of launch. |

The plan should emphasize involving stakeholders early (“Employees must be part of the change, rather than have it imposed” ([statcan.gc.ca](https://statcan.gc.ca))). Note stakeholders’ influence and what strategies will address their needs.
### Change Readiness Assessment

Outline any assessments done or to be done to gauge organizational readiness ([statcan.gc.ca](https://statcan.gc.ca)). For example, mention an organizational readiness survey or using past change history. If an analysis indicates, say, low readiness, plan some pre-implementation activities (like extra training or communications) to build readiness. This section shows a baseline of where people are at regarding the change.

### Communication Plan (for Change)

While the Project Plan had a communications section, this one is specifically about change-related communications: what messages need to go out, from whom, and when. Include key messages to each stakeholder group. For example:  
- Announce project and benefits to all staff via Deputy Minister memo (Gate 2).  
- Monthly newsletter updates via internal site.  
- Town halls with affected branches two months before go-live.  

Emphasize two-way communication ([statcan.gc.ca](https://statcan.gc.ca)) – how will feedback be collected? (suggestion boxes, regular meetings, change agents in teams). “Information sharing” is a critical component: ensure that as stakeholders voice concerns, the project responds and updates them ([statcan.gc.ca](https://statcan.gc.ca)). In GC, bilingual communications may be required – note that all staff communications will be in both official languages.

### Training Plan

Detail how users will be trained for the new process/system. Identify training audience, format (e.g., classroom, online modules, on-the-job training), and timing (relative to rollout). Include developing training materials, user guides, etc. For example:  
- Deliver 10 training sessions (in English and French) for approximately 200 staff in the month prior to launch.  
- Develop a user manual and quick-reference cheat sheet.  

Mention if you’ll do a train-the-trainer approach or have super-users. Link this to stakeholder analysis (certain groups might need more intensive training). Also, plan for post-launch support (like on-site floor support or a helpline).

### Resistance Management

Anticipate areas of resistance (maybe from the stakeholder analysis) and plan actions to address them. For instance, if frontline staff fear increased workload, plan to involve them in design so the solution actually makes their job easier (thus reducing resistance). If a union is involved, mention coordinating with union representatives early. Provide a strategy for handling negative feedback or adoption issues – e.g., extra coaching for those struggling, addressing misinformation with factual communications, etc.

### Change Champion Network

Many public-sector change plans establish a network of change agents or champions – people embedded in the affected groups who help facilitate the change. If applicable, describe how champions will be selected and utilized. For example:  
> “Each regional office will have a Change Champion who will get advanced training and act as a local point of contact for questions and feedback. They will meet weekly with the project change lead to share progress and issues.”  

This is a known best practice to ensure broad engagement.

### Timeline of Change Activities

Provide a schedule of major change management activities aligned with project phases. For example:

- **Planning Phase:**  
    - Conduct stakeholder analysis (date)  
    - Change strategy approved (date)  

- **Development Phase:**  
    - Regular update communications (monthly)  
    - Involve users in UAT (date)  

- **Pre-Implementation Phase:**  
    - Deliver training (date)  
    - Hold town hall (date)  

- **Post-Go-Live Phase:**  
    - 1-week daily debrief meetings to gather feedback  
    - Celebrate successes event (date)  

A table or list can illustrate this. This ensures change activities are not one-and-done but continuous throughout the project lifecycle.

### Measurement and Reinforcement

Describe how you will measure adoption and embed the change. For example:  
- Track metrics like “% of users actively using new system by X date”  
- Survey for user satisfaction after implementation  

Plan for follow-ups:  
- “We will conduct a post-implementation survey 3 months after go-live to assess if further training or support is needed.”  

Also mention any reward/recognition for adoption, such as recognizing teams that transitioned effectively. This helps reinforce the change.

### Style Tips for Change Management Plan

This document can have a slightly more narrative style when describing how people experience the change, but still keep it professional. Empathy is key – acknowledge concerns (“Employees may feel uncertainty...”) and then outline plans to address them. Use sub-headings for each major component (Communication, Training, etc.) for clarity.  

It’s often beneficial to use bullets and tables for stakeholder analysis and communications plans as noted, because it organizes complex info clearly. Ensure language is positive and proactive (focus on what will be done to help people adapt, rather than just stating change will happen). For example, instead of “There might be resistance,” write “Potential resistance will be managed by [specific action].”  

Since GC has a bilingual environment, if the project affects the public or a bilingual workforce, note that all change materials will be in both official languages, and possibly culturally adapted if needed for different regions.  

Tie the plan back to project success metrics: explicitly say that successful change management is critical to realize benefits (reinforcing the notion that a project can deliver outputs but only through adoption do we get outcomes). This will underline to reviewers why investing time/effort in OCM is worth it.  

Also, incorporate any lessons learned from past GC initiatives:  
- For example, Phoenix pay system issues taught the government a lot about the importance of user training and gradual rollout.  
- You could say, “Lessons learned from previous transformation projects in the GC have highlighted the need for robust change management – this plan incorporates those lessons by ensuring end-user engagement and thorough training.”  

Such references (even general) signal that this plan is built on best practices.  

Finally, be realistic and specific:  
- Identify who is responsible for change activities (maybe a “Change Management Lead” in the team, or the Project Manager might take it on for smaller projects).  
- If external expertise (like a consultant or the HR branch’s OCM specialists) is used, mention that collaboration.  

### e. Additional Artifacts (Examples)

(Note: The question specifically highlighted Business Case, Project Charter, Project Plan, Change Management Plan. For completeness, here are brief notes on a couple of other common artifacts, which PolicyGPT might also handle as needed. If not required, these can be skipped or just referenced.)

#### Benefits Realization Plan

Ensure it lists each expected benefit, how to measure it (KPIs), baseline values, target values, timeline, and who is responsible for each. It should align with the outcomes in the Business Case ([statcan.gc.ca](https://statcan.gc.ca)). It often extends beyond project end, so include how the organization will continue to monitor benefits (e.g., through an operational performance team or a benefits owner). Use a table format for clarity. Also mention reporting:  
> “Benefits realization status will be reported to the DG quarterly for two years post-project.”

#### Post-Implementation Review (PIR) Report

Outline how the project’s actual performance compared to plan (schedule, budget, deliverables). Include an assessment of whether the benefits are starting to materialize. Also, crucially, lessons learned – positive and negative – with recommendations for future projects ([canada.ca](https://canada.ca)). The tone here is reflective and honest (acknowledge issues). Keep it structured by areas:  
- **What went well**  
- **What didn’t**  
- **Actions for the future**  

For example:  
> “Future projects should engage end-users earlier to avoid late requirement changes.”

This document is usually prepared at Gate 5 or shortly after.

#### Project Gating Plan

If needed as a separate document (often it might be an appendix to the PMP), list the gates, their timing, and who will be on the gate review board. PolicyGPT can generate a simple table from the YAML for this.

Each of these additional artifacts should maintain the same style guidelines as above – formal, structured, and complete.

### 3. Sample Artifact Templates and Examples (Markdown)

In this section, we present gold-standard example structures for some of the most common artifacts (as identified above). These are provided in Markdown format to serve as templates or illustrative examples. They are tailored to Government of Canada language and expectations, and include metadata notes (e.g., where the artifact is used in the gating process, and key sections).

**Note:** The following are templates/outlines with example content hints. They are not filled with real project data, but demonstrate what a well-structured document should contain. PolicyGPT can use these as starting points when generating actual content for a specific project.

#### Example: Business Case (Detailed – Gate 2)

**Artifact:** Business Case (Detailed)  
**Gate:** Used at Gate 2 (“Approve preferred option and approach”) for seeking project approval. Also revisited at Gate 3 (updated if needed) for funding confirmation.  

**Required Sections:**  
- Executive Summary  
- Strategic Alignment  
- Options Analysis  
- Cost-Benefit  
- Risk Assessment  
- Recommendation  
- Implementation Plan (overview)  

Below is a template outline for a Detailed Business Case, with section headings and brief guidance for each:

```markdown

# Project X Business Case (Detailed)

**Project Name:** Project X – [Descriptive Title]  
**Sponsoring Department:** [Department Name]  
**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Month Day, Year]  
**Prepared by:** [Author/Team]

## 1. Executive Summary
*[Summarize the business need, the options considered, the recommended option, and key figures (cost, timeline, benefits).]*

The purpose of this business case is to recommend a solution to **[briefly state problem/opportunity]**, in order to achieve **[key outcomes]**. Three options were analyzed, including maintaining the status quo. **Option 3 ([Name]) is recommended** as it provides the best value and alignment with the organization’s strategic objectives.

- **Business Need:** [One-sentence description of problem or opportunity].  
- **Recommended Solution:** Option 3 – [name of option]. This option will [briefly how it solves the problem].  
- **Estimated Cost:** $X (total over 5 years).  
- **Expected Benefits:** [e.g., $Y in cost savings annually, improved client satisfaction by Z%, compliance with mandate, etc.].  
- **Timeline:** [e.g., 2 years implementation, with launch by FY2025-26].  
- **Key Risks:** [e.g., moderate schedule risk due to procurement; high change management risk – mitigations in place].

Decision required: *Approval to proceed with implementation of Option 3, with an expenditure authority of $X.* 

## 2. Strategic Alignment
*[Describe how the project aligns with departmental and GoC priorities, and why it’s important to do now.]*

**Mandate and Priorities:** This project supports [Department Name]’s strategic objective of _[cite objective from Departmental Plan]_. It is aligned with Government of Canada priorities, specifically _[e.g., the Digital Government initiative or Policy on Service Improvement]_. By addressing [problem], the project contributes to **[Broader outcome]** (e.g., “improved public access to services” or “internal efficiency in program delivery”), which remains a high priority.

**Context and Urgency:** [Explain background – what led to this project? Any impetus like audit findings, performance issues, or external drivers.] For example, _Recent audits have highlighted inefficiencies in the current process, resulting in service delays_. The opportunity to modernize now aligns with availability of new technology and the need to replace aging systems (the legacy system will be unsupported by 2026).

If not pursued now, **[consequences]** (e.g., “operational costs will continue to rise by ~5% annually and client satisfaction will likely decline further”). In summary, the project is **timely and necessary** to ensure the department can meet its objectives and government-wide commitments (such as [cite any relevant TB policy or directive]).

## 3. Business Needs and Outcomes
*[Explain the problem in detail and define what outcomes the project aims to achieve.]*

**Problem/Opportunity Statement:** _[Describe the core problem]_ – e.g., “Clients currently face an average 5-week turnaround for service requests due to a heavily paper-based process, leading to low satisfaction.” The process is resource-intensive and cannot meet growing demand. This presents an opportunity to leverage digital solutions to improve efficiency.

**Root Causes:** [If known, briefly mention the cause of the problem – e.g., outdated software, fragmented processes, etc.]. In this case, the root causes include **legacy IT systems**, and **manual workflow** that limits scalability:contentReference[oaicite:144]{index=144}.

**Desired Outcomes:** The project aims to achieve:
- **Outcome 1:** Reduced service turnaround time from 5 weeks to 1 week (80% improvement).
- **Outcome 2:** Improved client satisfaction by at least 20% (from survey baseline of X to Y).
- **Outcome 3:** Internal cost savings of $Z per year by streamlining processes (reallocating staff to higher-value work).
- **Outcome 4:** Compliance with [specific policy/legislation], eliminating current manual reporting steps.

These outcomes will deliver tangible benefits to Canadians (faster service) and to the department (more efficient operations). Success will be measured via KPIs such as processing time, satisfaction scores, and cost per transaction.

## 4. Options Analysis
*[Present the options considered, including status quo, with analysis of each.]*

Three viable options were identified and evaluated (along with the Status Quo for comparison):

**Option 1 – Status Quo (Do Nothing):** Continue with the current process and systems.
- **Description:** No major changes; address issues with minor tweaks only.
- **Costs:** Minimal new investment, but ongoing operating cost remains ~$X/year (staff overtime, maintenance of old system).
- **Benefits:** None beyond current state. No improvement in service times or quality.
- **Risks:** High risk of service degradation as demand grows; legacy system failure risk increases (end-of-life nearing). Does not address audit recommendations.
- **Assessment:** **Not recommended.** While cheapest in short term, it fails to meet the business need and would likely lead to continued or worsened service issues, misalignment with GoC digital goals, and eventual crisis if the system fails.

**Option 2 – Moderate Enhancement:** Implement incremental improvements to current system (e.g., partial automation) and add staffing.
- **Description:** Invest in a module to digitize some forms and hire 5 additional staff to handle increased volume.
- **Costs:** Estimated capital cost $1M (one-time) + $0.5M/yr operating (staff, maintenance).
- **Benefits:** Could reduce turnaround from 5 weeks to ~3 weeks (some process steps automated). Slight improvement in client satisfaction expected. 
- **Risks:** Medium. Some technical risk integrating new module with legacy system. Adds ongoing HR costs. Doesn’t fully eliminate manual work, so benefits are limited.
- **Assessment:** Addresses the problem partially. Turnaround improves, but not to target level; ongoing costs rise due to more staff. Might be acceptable as a short-term fix but not a sustainable long-term solution. 

**Option 3 – Digital Transformation (Recommended):** Replace the paper process with a new end-to-end digital service platform.
- **Description:** Procure or develop a modern Service Portal for online requests, with automated workflow and integration to backend databases. Phase out legacy system. Implement accompanying process changes (e.g., electronic approvals).
- **Costs:** Estimated $5M over 2 years (development/procurement, implementation) + $0.8M/year operating (licenses, cloud hosting, minor support). *See Cost-Benefit section for breakdown.* 
- **Benefits:** Turnaround time projected to drop to 1 week or less (auto-routing requests). FTE savings equivalent to $500k/year once fully implemented (staff can be reassigned from data entry to client advisory roles). Improved accuracy and tracking of requests. Aligns with GC Digital Standards (e.g., user-centric design, open-source tech).
- **Risks:** Medium-High initial risk. New IT implementation risk (mitigated by using experienced vendor and iterative development). Change management risk: significant changes for staff workflows (mitigations detailed in Change Management Plan). 
- **Assessment:** **Recommended.** This option best meets project objectives, with major improvements in service and long-term savings. It has higher upfront cost but a strong business case (NPV positive over 5 years). It modernizes the department’s service delivery, supporting strategic goals and future scalability. Risks are manageable with proper controls (as planned).

*Rationale:* Option 3 is recommended because it substantially achieves the desired outcomes (unlike Option 1) and offers greater benefits and long-term efficiency than Option 2. Although it requires higher initial investment, the return on investment is favorable by Year 3, and intangible benefits (client satisfaction, better data) further justify it.

## 5. Cost-Benefit Analysis of Recommended Option
*[Provide detailed financial analysis for the recommended option, and summarize comparison with status quo.]*

**Projected Costs (Option 3):** Total **$5.0M** over 5 years (implementation + first 3 years operation). Breakdown:
- Development/Procurement: $3.5M (FY2023-24 to FY2024-25) – includes software purchase or development costs, implementation services, project staff.
- Hardware/Infrastructure: $0.5M (one-time in FY2024-25) – for new servers or cloud setup.
- Training & Change Management: $0.2M (over two years) – dedicated funds for staff training, engagement.
- Ongoing Operations: ~$0.8M per year from FY2025-26 onward – cloud hosting, software licensing, maintenance, and minor enhancements.

**Projected Benefits:** Starting FY2025-26:
- Staff time savings worth ~$500k/year (equivalent to 10 FTEs) by eliminating manual data entry and follow-ups. These FTEs will be reassigned to other priority areas (capacity creation).
- Avoided cost of legacy system maintenance ~$200k/year (once shut down in 2026).
- Intangible: Faster turnaround could improve productivity for clients (though not directly monetized, this improves public trust and program outcomes).

**Net Present Value (NPV):** Over a 5-year horizon, NPV is approximately **+$2M** (discount rate 7%). The investment breaks even in Year 4. (Detailed cash flow analysis in Appendix A.)

**Cost-Benefit Comparison:** Compared to Status Quo (which would cost ~$7M total over same period in staffing and maintenance with no new benefits), Option 3 yields an estimated **$3M** in net savings over 5 years. Option 2 yields some savings vs Status Quo, but much less (~$1M over 5 years) and still carries higher operating costs long-term than Option 3.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** Even if benefits are 25% less than expected (e.g., only 5 FTE saved instead of 10), the NPV remains positive (~+$500k). A risk of 20% project cost overrun would delay breakeven by about 1 year, but benefits would still outweigh costs over the asset life. These analyses show the recommendation is robust financially.

## 6. Risk Assessment
*[Summarize key risks of the recommended option and how they’ll be managed.]*

The recommended project option carries some risks which will be actively managed:

- **Implementation Risk (Technology):** *Risk:* The new service platform development could encounter delays or technical issues. *Mitigation:* Adopt an agile development approach with iterative testing; engage experienced vendors with proven GC implementations; conduct architecture reviews and security assessments early. Contingency budget (~15%) set aside for unforeseen technical challenges.
- **Change Adoption Risk:** *Risk:* Employees may resist or have difficulty adapting to the new digital process, impacting benefit realization:contentReference[oaicite:145]{index=145}. *Mitigation:* Comprehensive Change Management Plan in place – including training, stakeholder engagement (see separate plan). Engaging staff in design and testing (user champions) to increase buy-in:contentReference[oaicite:146]{index=146}. Management will reinforce the change with clear communication of benefits and support.
- **Procurement Risk:** *Risk:* The RFP for a vendor might result in higher cost or protests delaying the project. *Mitigation:* Early engagement with procurement specialists (PSPC/SSC) to ensure a clear RFP and evaluation criteria; using a pre-qualified vendor list if possible to streamline. Include realistic timelines in the plan (already accounted for a 6-month procurement window).
- **Data Migration Risk:** *Risk:* Historic data might be difficult to migrate accurately to new system. *Mitigation:* Plan data migration strategy well in advance; run pilot migration tests; if needed, archive old data separately and start fresh moving forward (decision to be confirmed in design phase).
- **Benefit Shortfall Risk:** *Risk:* The expected efficiency gains (FTE savings) may not fully materialize if, for example, volume of requests increases or if staff are not reallocated. *Mitigation:* Benefits Realization Plan established – benefits will be tracked and a benefits owner (Business Director) is assigned:contentReference[oaicite:147]{index=147}. Will adjust processes to ensure efficiency gains are captured (e.g., redesign jobs to capitalize on freed time).

Overall project risk is assessed as **Medium** (per the preliminary PCRA, see Appendix B). The project team will maintain a risk register and review it bi-weekly, with major risks reported to the Steering Committee monthly. This proactive risk management aligns with Treasury Board expectations and past lessons learned on major projects.

## 7. Implementation Plan Overview
*[Describe at a high level how the project will be implemented if approved.]*

**Project Phases:** The project will be executed in the following phases:
1. **Initiation & Planning (Q1–Q2 2024):** Finalize project plan, form team, prepare procurement documents. **(Gate 3)** – Treasury Board approval obtained; detailed planning completed.
2. **Procurement & Design (Q3–Q4 2024):** Conduct RFP and award contract to solution provider by Q4. Begin requirements confirmation and solution design with vendor and key users involved.
3. **Development & Testing (Q1–Q4 2025):** Vendor builds the system in iterations. Internal project team performs iterative testing (including accessibility and security testing). UAT (User Acceptance Testing) in Q4 2025 with a pilot group of staff. Adjust as needed.
4. **Implementation (Q1 2026):** Training for all users in Jan–Feb 2026. Data migration late Feb. **(Gate 4)** – Confirm readiness for go-live (all criteria met: thorough testing, training completed, support in place):contentReference[oaicite:148]{index=148}. Launch new system in March 2026, with parallel run of old system for 1 month as backup.
5. **Close-Out (Q2 2026):** Decommission legacy system by April 2026. **(Gate 5)** – project close-out and post-implementation review by May 2026.
6. **Post-Implementation (FY 2026-27):** Benefits monitoring and support transition to operations (handled by operations team, with project team oversight for 3 months post-launch). A formal benefits review at 6 and 12 months post-launch to evaluate outcomes.

**Governance During Implementation:** The Project Steering Committee (chaired by DG of [Branch]) will meet monthly (or more frequently during critical stages) to monitor progress, resolve escalated issues, and authorize any scope/cost changes. An independent reviewer (from TBS Centre of Excellence or hired externally) will be invited at Gate 4 to validate readiness (as per the project gating plan).

**Change Management and Training:** (In brief, tie to Change Plan) All staff impacted will receive training 4-6 weeks prior to go-live, and change champions in each region will support peers through the transition. Regular communications (monthly newsletters, demos) will continue through development to keep users informed and involved.

**Procurement Strategy:** The main solution will be acquired through a competitive process (RFP) using a **Best Value** evaluation to ensure quality. This is already in progress (draft SOW prepared). Contracts will include clear deliverables and performance incentives to ensure on-time delivery. PSPC’s Procurement Branch is engaged to assist, and an industry day was held to gauge market solutions.

**Resource Plan:** The project will be delivered by a dedicated team of X FTEs from the department (mix of business analysts, IT specialists, project management) plus the vendor’s team. Additional support from corporate services (procurement, finance, HR for training coordination) is arranged. The project manager is [Name, Title], and the business lead is [Name] who heads the affected operations.

**Outcome Management:** After implementation, the responsibility for ongoing benefits tracking transitions to the business owner ([Director of Operations]). The Benefits Realization Plan outlines metrics and reporting that will continue beyond project closure to ensure sustained focus on outcomes:contentReference[oaicite:149]{index=149}.

This high-level plan demonstrates that the project is **ready to proceed** upon approval, with a clear roadmap and controls in place. Detailed project management plans (schedule, risk register, etc.) are available in the Project Plan document and will be updated continuously.

## 8. Conclusion and Recommendation
*[Conclude by re-iterating the recommendation and next steps.]*

In conclusion, implementing **Option 3 (Digital Service Transformation)** is the most advantageous path forward. It addresses the business problem effectively, aligns with strategic directions, and offers a strong return on investment with significant service improvements for Canadians. The project is well-planned with governance, risk mitigation, and change management strategies set to ensure success.

**Recommendation:** It is recommended that Treasury Board (or appropriate authority) **approve Project X to proceed** with Option 3, with a total budget of $5.0M and a planned completion by March 2026. Upon approval, the project team will immediately initiate the procurement process and formally kick off the execution phase as per the outlined plan.

- Roles & Governance  
- Budget  
- Risks  
- Assumptions  
- Approvals  

Below is a template outline for a Project Charter:

```markdown

# Project X Charter

**Project Title:** Project X – [Short Descriptive Title]  
**Sponsoring Department:** [Dept/Agency Name]  
**Sponsor (SRO):** [Name, Title of Senior Responsible Officer]  
**Project Manager:** [Name, Title]  
**Version:** 0.1 (Preliminary Charter)  
**Date:** [Month Day, Year]

## 1. Introduction
**Project Background:**  
Project X is initiated to **[solve X problem / achieve Y opportunity]**. This initiative stems from [brief background, e.g., “the need to modernize service ABC”]. It was identified in [planning document or mandate] and is now being chartered to formally begin work.

This Charter formally authorizes Project X and outlines its objectives, scope, and governance. The project will proceed through the Treasury Board gating process, starting with this Gate 1 approval to develop a detailed Business Case and Project Plan.

**Project Objectives:**  
- **Objective 1:** [e.g., Reduce processing time by 50% for service requests].  
- **Objective 2:** [e.g., Improve compliance with policy X by implementing new controls].  
- **Objective 3:** [etc., make sure objectives are SMART where possible].

These objectives align with [Dept Name]’s strategic goals, such as _[reference specific goal if applicable]_.

## 2. Project Scope
**In Scope:**  
- Development of [new system or process] to [do what].  
- Re-engineering of [business process XYZ] in [Branch/Division].  
- Training and change management for all impacted staff (approx. N employees).  
- Integration with [related system] for data sharing.

**Out of Scope:**  
- Changes to [other process that is related but handled separately] (that will be addressed by a different initiative).  
- Upgrades to infrastructure beyond what’s needed for this project (use existing infrastructure).  
- [Any other exclusions to clarify boundaries].

This scope will be refined in the planning phase but establishes the boundaries of Project X’s mandate.

**Deliverables:** (Major Deliverables)  
1. **Deliverable 1:** [New software system] – including modules A, B, C.  
2. **Deliverable 2:** [Updated Business Process Documentation] – SOPs and manuals for the new process.  
3. **Deliverable 3:** [Training Program] delivered to all users.  
4. **Deliverable 4:** [Transition of operations/support] to the responsible team.

**Major Milestones & Gates:**  
- *Gate 2:* Business Case approval of preferred option – Target Date: **[Month Year]**.  
- *Gate 3:* Treasury Board funding approval – Target Date: **[Month Year]**.  
- *Solution Design Complete:* [Month Year].  
- *Development Complete:* [Month Year].  
- *Gate 4:* Readiness for service (UAT complete, etc.) – **[Month Year]**.  
- *Go-Live:* [Month Year].  
- *Gate 5:* Project closure (Post-Implementation Review) – **[Month Year]**.

*(The above are indicative dates; a detailed schedule will be developed.)*

## 3. Project Budget (High-Level)
The preliminary estimated budget for the project is **$X** (rough order of magnitude). This includes:
- $A for development/procurement,
- $B for internal staffing,
- $C for change management and training,
- $D contingency (~15% of total).

Funding is expected from [source, e.g., “reallocated departmental funds” or “Treasury Board submission”]. At Gate 1, funding of $Y is approved for planning phase activities (e.g., developing the business case, options analysis).

A detailed cost breakdown and funding strategy will be provided in the Business Case at Gate 2. The project will adhere to this budget unless a change is formally approved via project governance.

## 4. Assumptions and Constraints
**Assumptions:**  
- Key expertise (e.g., business analysts, IT architects) will be available from internal resources as scheduled.  
- Required funding will be approved at Gate 3 to continue beyond planning.  
- The vendor market has solutions that meet our requirements (feasibility of Option 3 is based on assumption that at least one COTS product exists for our needs).  
- Stakeholders will actively participate in requirements and testing phases.

**Constraints:**  
- Timeline constraint: The new system ideally must be operational by [Date] due to [e.g., legislative change or contract expiry of old system].  
- Regulatory: Solution must comply with Government of Canada IT security policies, Privacy Act, Official Languages Act for bilingual service.  
- Resource constraints: The team cannot exceed N full-time staff due to departmental limits; external contracting is capped at $Z without further approval.

These assumptions and constraints will be validated and monitored. Any significant changes will be addressed via the change control process.

## 5. Risks (High-Level)
Initial risk identification has been conducted:
- **Risk 1: Project complexity** – Rated High. Mitigation: Follow TBS gating and independent review guidelines; ensure experienced PM and team are in place; conduct PCRA (Preliminary rating is Medium-High).  
- **Risk 2: Adoption risk** – Medium. There is a risk that users might not adopt the new system (change resistance). Mitigation: Develop a strong Change Management Plan (see section 8) and involve users early.  
- **Risk 3: Procurement delay** – Medium. If the RFP process takes longer than expected, timeline slips. Mitigation: Start procurement prep early (already initiated); use existing procurement vehicles where possible (e.g., SSC SaaS framework).  
- **Risk 4: Scope creep** – Low/Medium. Stakeholders might attempt to add features. Mitigation: Strict scope management and steering committee oversight for any changes.

A more detailed risk register will be maintained in the Project Plan. At this stage, no risks have been identified that are deemed “unacceptable” – all are manageable with the planned strategies.

## 6. Project Governance
**Governance Structure:**  
A robust governance is established to oversee Project X:
- **Project Sponsor / Senior Responsible Owner (SRO):** [Name, Title]. The SRO is accountable for project success and will champion the project, ensuring it remains aligned with strategic objectives and securing necessary resources:contentReference[oaicite:153]{index=153}.
- **Steering Committee:** Chaired by the SRO, with members including [Director IT], [Director Operations – business owner], [CFO or delegate], and [perhaps reps from key stakeholder groups]. This committee will meet quarterly (and as needed at gate reviews) to provide guidance, approve major deliverables, and make go/no-go decisions at gates.
- **Project Manager:** [Name] (Project Management Office). The PM has authority for day-to-day project execution, decision-making within scope/time/budget tolerances, and reports to the SRO and Steering Committee. 
- **Project Team Leads:** 
  - Business Lead: [Name] – responsible for requirements and ensuring the solution meets business needs.
  - Technical Lead/Solution Architect: [Name] – responsible for technical design and build.
  - Change Management Lead: [Name] – responsible for stakeholder engagement and training (works with HR and Communications as needed).
  - etc., as applicable (QA Lead, Security Lead, etc.).
- **Independent Reviewer:** (If applicable) The project may undergo independent reviews (e.g., Gate 4 assessment) by TBS or external reviewers to provide unbiased status reports.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**  
A RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) is summarized below for key activities:
- *Project Plan development:* R = Project Manager, A = SRO, C = Team Leads, I = Steering Committee.
- *Business Case preparation:* R = Business Lead/PM, A = SRO, C = CFO (for financials), I = Steering Committee.
- *Technical Implementation:* R = Technical Lead & Vendor, A = Project Manager, C = Business Lead (on functionality), I = Steering Committee.
- *Change Management:* R = Change Lead, A = Project Manager, C = Business Lead, I = All staff (through comms).
*(Note: A detailed RACI chart will be maintained in project docs.)*

**Decision Making:**  
Day-to-day decisions are made by the Project Manager within the scope of the plan. Strategic decisions, scope changes, or issues that could impact objectives or budget beyond tolerance are escalated to the Steering Committee. The SRO has final decision authority on behalf of the department, and TB approval will be sought for any funding increases beyond original authority.

## 7. Project Organization Structure
*(An org chart can be represented in text or described.)*

- **Senior Management Sponsor:** Deputy Head or ADM – [Name] (if they oversee the SRO).
- **Senior Responsible Owner (Project Sponsor):** [Name, Title] – Accountable for benefits and overall success.
- **Steering Committee Members:** [List – Name (Title), etc.].
- **Project Core Team:** Project Manager (Name), Business Lead (Name), Technical Lead (Name), Change Lead (Name), etc.
- **Working Groups:** If any specific working groups or subcommittees (e.g., user group, technical architecture group) are established, mention them here and their purpose.

The project organization draws expertise from multiple sectors (IT, program area, corporate). Key stakeholders not in the core team (e.g., regional reps) will be engaged through [e.g., a User Advisory Group meeting monthly].

## 8. Additional Plans
*(Mention linkage to subsidiary plans, even if separate documents.)*

This charter is supported by further planning documents:
- **Project Gating Plan:** (Appendix or separate) outlines gate review points, aligning with TBS Guide to Project Gating.
- **Change Management Plan:** will be developed to ensure user adoption (see Risk 2 mitigation).
- **Communication Plan:** (if separate) to inform stakeholders throughout.
- **Benefit Realization Plan:** draft to be included in the Business Case at Gate 2.

These plans collectively ensure that all facets of the project are managed. The Project Manager will coordinate their development and execution.

The WBS dictionary (see Appendix for definitions of each element) provides detailed inclusions for each component. Work not described in the WBS is considered out of scope unless formally approved.

## 3. Schedule Management 
**Project Schedule:**  
A detailed project schedule has been developed in MS Project (maintained separately). Key milestones include:

- **Gate 3 (Project Approval):** [Date] – *Achieved*.  
- **Vendor Contract Awarded:** [Date].  
- **Completion of System Design:** [Date].  
- **Core System Developed:** [Date].  
- **UAT Completed (Gate 4 readiness):** [Date].  
- **Go-Live (Production Deployment):** [Date].  
- **Project Close-Out (Gate 5):** [Date].

The timeline is illustrated below (major phases):

_Phase_ (Timeline)  
- **Planning:** Jan – Mar 2024  
- **Procurement:** Apr – Sep 2024  
- **Development & Testing:** Oct 2024 – Dec 2025  
- **Implementation (Transition):** Jan – Mar 2026  
- **Close-Out:** Apr – May 2026  

**Schedule Management and Control:**  
- The Project Manager will track progress weekly against the schedule. A buffer of 4 weeks is included for potential delays in development (contingency built into timeline).
- Schedule progress will be reported in bi-weekly status meetings. Milestone slip > 2 weeks will trigger an exception report to the Steering Committee.
- The project uses a modified Agile approach during development (iterative deliveries every 2 months). Each iteration’s completion is a minor milestone; adjustments to scope or schedule may be made between iterations with Steering Committee approval, maintaining overall end date.
- A Gantt chart is maintained (see Appendix for high-level Gantt).

## 4. Cost Management 
**Budget Baseline:** (in CAD)
- **Total Project Budget:** $2,530,000 (over FY2023-24 to FY2025-26).
- **Breakdown:** 
  - Salaries (Internal staff): $1,100,000  
  - Professional Services (Vendor contracts): $800,000  
  - Software/Hardware: $400,000  
  - Training/Change Management: $100,000  
  - Contingency: $130,000 (approx. 5% of total)

*(Breakdown can be more detailed by year if needed.)*

**Funding Source:**  
TB approval (Vote 5 capital) provides $2.0M; Departmental reference level covers $0.53M in salary. Funding confirmed in CFO letter dated [Date].

**Cost Control:**  
- The Project Manager and project finance officer will review expenditures monthly. Actuals vs budget will be tracked in the departmental financial system with a project code.
- Variance thresholds: If any budget category is expected to exceed 10% variance, or total project cost threatens to exceed $2.53M, an immediate escalation to Sponsor and CFO is required. Minor variances within contingency will be managed by the Project Manager with Sponsor awareness.
- Change requests that require additional funding must be approved by the Steering Committee and may require Treasury Board amendment if above approved limits.
- Regular financial reports (monthly) will be provided to the Steering Committee.

**Procurement Spend Timing:** (for awareness)
- Major contract (implementation vendor) – ~$600k in FY24-25, ~$200k in FY25-26.
- License renewals – $50k annually starting FY26-27 (outside project budget, handed to ops).

## 5. Quality Management 
**Quality Objectives:**  
Deliverables must meet the requirements and standards set by the business and technical stakeholders. Key quality criteria:
- New system must pass all user acceptance tests (100% of critical test cases) and meet performance standards (e.g., response time <2s for key transactions).
- Documentation (user guides, SOPs) must be complete and reviewed by end-users for clarity.
- Compliance with Government of Canada standards (Security Assessment & Authorization, WCAG 2.1 accessibility for user interface, Official Languages – bilingual interface).

**Quality Control Activities:**  
- **Requirements Sign-off:** Ensure all business requirements are clearly documented and approved by business owner (baseline for quality).
- **Design & Code Reviews:** The technical lead will conduct peer reviews of vendor deliverables at each sprint end. GC architectural standards will be applied.
- **Testing:** A test plan covers unit, integration, system, and UAT. Independent testers from outside the project team (e.g., QA team or an external QA contractor) will verify outcomes. Testing will also cover security/vulnerability scans and performance testing.
- **Defect Management:** Issues discovered in testing will be logged in a tracking tool, prioritized, and resolved before go-live (critical defects must be fixed; minor defects get a mitigation or schedule for post-launch fix).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Defined for each deliverable. For example, “Training is accepted when at least 95% of staff have attended and passed a competency quiz” or “Workflow module is accepted when it processes 1,000 transactions in test with <1% error.”

**Quality Assurance:**  
The project may engage the Department’s QA Center or an independent IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) at Gate 4 to audit readiness. They will ensure process adherence and highlight any quality gaps.

**Continual Improvement:**  
Lessons learned sessions will be held after each major phase to improve processes in the next phase (e.g., after procurement, after development). Any improvements (like better communication protocols or updated templates) will be adopted immediately.

## 6. Resource Management 
**Project Team Structure & Roles:**  
- Project Manager – **[Name]** (FT): Overall coordination, scope, schedule, budget control.
- Business Lead – **[Name]** (50% allocation): Provide business requirements, user liaison, ensures solution meets business needs.
- Technical Lead – **[Name]** (FT): Oversee technical design, vendor technical management, ensure GC IT standards compliance.
- Change Management Lead – **[Name]** (PT or FT): Implement change plan (communications, training).
- Developers – **Vendor Team**: estimated 5 developers, 2 testers from Vendor Inc. (as per contract) – work under Technical Lead oversight.
- Business Analysts – **[Names]** (2 internal, FT for first 6 months): Document requirements, processes, assist in testing.
- Subject Matter Experts – [Maybe list reps from operations who will provide input while juggling regular duties].
- etc.

A more detailed RACI is in the charter; here we ensure all needed skill sets are accounted for. The team will scale down after deployment (most contractor resources end after acceptance).

**Resource Acquisition:**  
Internal resources have been secured via [branch commitments]. Backfill arrangements for their regular duties are in place for key roles (so project team can focus). External resources will be acquired through [the vendor contract for dev/test, plus perhaps a change management consultant if needed].

**Training for Team:**  
Project-specific training (e.g., on the new technology stack) will be provided to internal team members by vendor (as knowledge transfer). Also, ensure all team members understand TBS policies relevant to the project (a briefing on GC project management/gating was done during kickoff).

**Team Communication:**  
The project team will have daily stand-up meetings (15 min) during development sprints to coordinate. A weekly full team meeting covers broader issues. Tools: using MS Teams/GCcollab for collaboration, GCdocs for document repository, etc.

**Resource Calendars & Constraints:**  
Be aware of holidays, fiscal year-end slowdowns, and respective team members’ availability. E.g., key SMEs from operations are not available in peak season (August), so schedule UAT accordingly. The project schedule has been adjusted to account for these constraints.

## 7. Communications Management 
**Stakeholder Identification:**  
Key stakeholders and their information needs:
- **Senior Executive (DG, ADM):** Want strategic updates and reassurance project is on track. We will provide quarterly briefings and an executive dashboard.
- **Steering Committee:** Will receive monthly status reports (written) and meet quarterly. Reports include progress, risks, financial status.
- **Project Team:** Daily syncs and weekly detailed meetings as mentioned (to ensure internal alignment).
- **Affected Employees (Users):** Via Change Management Plan – bi-monthly newsletters, intranet updates, and town halls before major milestones.
- **Clients/Public (if external impact):** Notify via program communications closer to launch about new service (coordinating with Communications branch).
- **Central Agencies (TBS):** If required (for Major project), quarterly reports will be submitted to TBS per Directive on Projects.

A stakeholder register (Appendix) lists all stakeholders, their interest/influence, and communication approach.

**Communication Vehicles and Frequency:**  
- **Status Report:** Bi-weekly internal status report (one-pager) to Sponsor and key team, highlighting accomplishments, next steps, issues, risks.
- **Steering Committee Deck:** Prior to each meeting, a slide deck with status, KPI updates, decisions needed will be circulated.
- **Team Kanban Board:** We maintain a visual task board (in Jira or Trello) accessible to all team members for day-to-day transparency.
- **Intranet Site:** A page on the department intranet is set up for Project X to share news, FAQs, and contact info for questions. This will be updated monthly or as milestones happen.
- **Town Halls:** Two rounds of town halls (virtual meetings) – one during design to gather input, one before launch to demonstrate the new system and answer questions.
- **Email Updates:** Targeted emails to managers in affected branches at key points (when training is scheduled, when system goes live, etc.).

**Feedback Mechanisms:**  
Communication is two-way: we have a dedicated project email for inquiries, and change champions feed back questions/concerns from staff. We’ll conduct quick pulse surveys after training and after launch to gauge how communications landed and if people felt informed.

## 8. Risk Management 
*(Summarize risk process and provide current snapshot of top risks; detailed register in Appendix.)*

**Risk Management Approach:**  
The project follows a proactive risk management process:
- The risk register is maintained by the Project Manager, updated continuously.
- Risks are identified through team brainstorming, expert input, and stakeholder feedback (ongoing).
- Each risk is assessed for probability and impact (on a 5-point scale), with a computed exposure level (Low/Med/High).
- Mitigation strategies or response plans are defined for each significant risk.
- A risk owner is assigned (team member best able to manage it).
- Risks and mitigation status are reviewed in the weekly team meeting and monthly at Steering Committee (with focus on high risks).

**Top Current Risks:** (see Appendix for full list)
1. **Procurement Delay** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* High (could delay project start). **Mitigation:** Aggressive timeline management for RFP, prepare documentation in advance, engage procurement early (Status: RFP draft completed, mitigating this risk down to Medium-Low).
2. **Technical Integration Issue** – *Probability:* Low, *Impact:* High. New system must interface with legacy database. **Mitigation:** Conduct proof-of-concept integration test early (planned in design phase); have vendor include integration expert; fallback plan to use a data export-import if live integration fails.
3. **User Adoption** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* High. (As noted, risk of staff not using new system properly.) **Mitigation:** Strong change management (see Change Plan), executive sponsorship messaging, and ample training. Early engagement of union if process changes affect job descriptions (Status: initial meetings with union reps done, no major concerns raised so far).
4. **Scope Creep** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* Medium. Users may request additional features once they see new system capabilities. **Mitigation:** Use a controlled Change Control process; prioritize a clear MVP (minimum viable product) for launch, defer nice-to-haves to future enhancements. Communicate scope boundaries clearly in every user engagement.
5. **Data Migration Quality** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* Medium. Risk of data loss or errors when migrating ~100k records. **Mitigation:** Thorough mapping and cleansing of data before migration; test migrations with sample data; run parallel system for 1 month to validate data integrity.

Each of these risks has a detailed contingency plan (documented in the risk register). No risks are currently identified as “High severity, unmanaged.” The risk exposure will be continually monitored. If any risk’s impact escalates, the Steering Committee will be alerted immediately, and additional mitigation or an alternate plan will be executed.

## 9. Procurement Management 
**Procurement Summary:**  
- **Main Contract:** Implementation services for system development (vendor). Approach: Competitive RFP via PSPC. RFP issued [Date], closing [Date]. Award planned [Date]. Evaluation involves project team and procurement specialists, using Best Value to balance cost/quality. The contract will be deliverables-based, with staged payments tied to milestones (design sign-off, beta delivery, final delivery). Vendor to also provide 1-year warranty support post-implementation included in contract.
- **Software Acquisition:** The chosen solution might involve COTS software. If Option for COTS, licenses will be procured via existing Shared Services Canada Software Vehicle to save time. If custom build, this is part of vendor contract.
- **Hardware/Cloud:** Using SSC provisions – e.g., cloud infrastructure through GC Cloud Framework (already coordinated, expected to use [Azure/AWS GC enclave]). Not a direct procurement the project handles, but a request to SSC with expected lead time of 8 weeks.
- **Other Procurements:** None major. (Training services might be contracted if internal resources insufficient, up to $50k, using a supply arrangement.)

**Procurement Schedule & Responsibilities:**  
- RFP Preparation – Responsible: Project Manager & Procurement Officer (Completed by [Date]).  
- Bid Evaluation – Responsible: Evaluation Committee (Project Manager, Tech Lead, Business Lead, Procurement Advisor) – [Date range].  
- Contract Award – Responsible: Procurement Authority (Director of Procurement) – by [Date].  
- SSC Cloud Request – Responsible: Technical Lead – submit by [Date] to ensure ready by [Date].

The project has accounted for procurement lead times in the schedule (6 months for RFP to award). If any procurement is significantly delayed or fails (e.g., no suitable vendor), fallback options include using an existing TB Standing Offer or adjusting scope to in-house development (with steering committee approval if needed).

All procurement will adhere to the **Treasury Board Contracting Policy** and trade agreements. Given the estimated contract size (~$800k), proper approvals (Departmental Contract Review Committee, etc.) will be sought concurrently. 

## 10. Change Control Management 
**Change Management Process (Project Changes):**  
To control scope, schedule, and cost, any change beyond predefined tolerances will go through formal change control:
- A **Change Request (CR)** form will be used to document: description of change, reason, analysis of impacts (on scope, timeline, cost, quality, risks), and alternatives considered.
- CRs can be submitted by any project stakeholder to the Project Manager. The PM logs it and does an initial analysis with the team.
- **Impact Analysis:** The project team (with relevant leads) assesses feasibility, effort, and impact of the requested change. They categorize it as Minor (can be absorbed with existing resources/schedule) or Major (affects baseline).
- **Approval Authority:** 
  - Minor changes (no impact on overall timeline, budget, and within scope boundaries) can be approved by the Project Manager and Sponsor.
  - Major changes (e.g., adding new deliverable, >2-week schedule impact, >$50k cost impact, or affecting critical objectives) must be reviewed by the Steering Committee. If it impacts external commitments or exceeds budget authority, TB or senior management re-approval might be required.
- **Decision Logging:** Every CR decision (approved or rejected) is recorded in the change log with rationale. The project plan, scope docs, and other baselines will be updated if a change is approved.
- **Communication of Changes:** Approved changes are communicated to all stakeholders (team gets updated work plans, steering committee minutes note it, and if needed broader communication to users if scope change affects deliverables they expect).

To minimize unnecessary changes, clear scope definition and stakeholder involvement from the start is emphasized (addressing needs early). This process ensures any necessary changes are controlled and documented, preventing scope creep from undermining project success:contentReference[oaicite:157]{index=157}.

*(Note: This section refers to project change control. For organizational change management, see the separate Change Management Plan document.)*

# Change Management Plan – Project X

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Month Day, Year]  
**Change Management Lead:** [Name]  
**Project Manager:** [Name] (Sponsor for OCM efforts)

## 1. Change Vision and Objectives
Project X will introduce significant changes to how [Department] operates [process/service]. The change vision is to **enable a smooth transition** from the current state to the future state where [describe new way of working]. This plan’s objective is to ensure that:
- **Awareness**: All impacted stakeholders understand *why* the change is happening and its benefits (addressing the “What’s in it for me?”).
- **Desire and Buy-in**: Stakeholders are engaged and generally supportive, minimizing resistance.
- **Knowledge and Ability**: Users have the necessary training and skills to perform their jobs in the new environment.
- **Reinforcement**: The change is sustained through ongoing support and recognition of the new ways of working.

In essence, success is when employees and other stakeholders have fully adopted the new system/process, allowing the project’s benefits (e.g., faster service) to be realized:contentReference[oaicite:161]{index=161}.

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis
A detailed analysis of those affected by this change was conducted:

| Stakeholder Group          | Impact of Change (What & How)                          | Readiness Level | Key Concerns                | Change Strategy                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Front-line staff** (Service agents) | High impact: daily process changes, new IT system. | Medium (mixed readiness) | Fear of job redundancy, learning curve for new system, loss of control over workflow. | - Involve in user testing/design.<br>- Provide hands-on training and user manual.<br>- Assure no job losses, role will shift to more client-facing tasks (communicate this clearly).<br>- Identify peer champions among them. |
| **Service Managers** (team leads) | Medium impact: need to manage staff through change, new reporting tools. | Medium-High (generally positive) | Concern about short-term drop in productivity, ensuring team follows new process. | - Engage in change leadership workshop.<br>- Give access to system early (pilot) to familiarize.<br>- Weekly check-ins during rollout to address issues managers observe.<br>- Equip with change coaching tips for their staff. |
| **Clients/Public** (if applicable) | Medium impact: new self-service portal option. | (N/A – not internal readiness) | Usability concerns, access for those less tech-savvy. | - Early communication campaign about new portal benefits.<br>- Provide transitional support (helpdesk, in-person assistance) for first 3 months.<br>- Ensure bilingual support and accessibility. |
| **IT Support Staff** (Operations) | Medium impact: new system to support post-project. | Medium | Need technical knowledge transfer, capacity to support new app. | - Include IT ops staff in training sessions with vendor.<br>- Provide system documentation and a shadowing period post-launch.<br>- Possibly augment support team temporarily post-launch. |
| **Union** (if staff roles significantly affected) | Low-Medium: want assurance no violation of collective agreements or job security. | Unknown (to be determined) | Potential concern if workload or job descriptions change. | - Proactively brief union representatives on changes (done in planning).<br>- Provide data on how workload will improve, not worsen.<br>- Invite union feedback and address any issues openly. |

*(Additional groups can be listed, e.g., other departments if they interface with this process.)*

**Findings:** Stakeholder analysis revealed generally positive attitudes toward modernizing (especially among newer staff), but pockets of anxiety among long-tenured employees used to the old system. We also identified that a culture of “we’ve seen many projects come and go” exists – some skepticism on whether this change will stick. Thus, transparency and involvement are crucial to overcome cynicism.

This analysis informs targeted strategies per group as noted. **Stakeholder engagement is a continuous process** – we will update this analysis after each engagement (e.g., post-training feedback).

## 3. Change Readiness Assessment
A readiness assessment was conducted via a staff survey and management interviews in [Month]. Key insights:
- About 60% of staff felt they had “some” or “high” awareness of the upcoming project (we need to raise this closer to 100% – an early communication gap to fill).
- Resistance level: Approximately 25% expressed concern or opposition to the change (mostly around job impact and fear of technology). This is manageable but indicates a need for targeted reassurance and support for that segment.
- Organizational culture: historically, similar transformations (like moving to eRecords in 2018) saw initial pushback but were successful after strong training efforts – indicating that with proper support, adoption will happen.
- **Change agents identified:** A number of staff (especially those who are tech-savvy or frustrated with old process) volunteered to champion the change. We have identified at least one “Change Champion” in each regional office and major team.

Overall readiness is **moderate** – there is openness to the benefits, but also anxiety. We conclude that a structured change program (as detailed here) is required to move readiness to high. No insurmountable cultural barriers were found, but management must visibly support this change (change readiness is stronger where managers are engaged).

We will conduct a follow-up readiness pulse check one month before go-live to adjust actions if needed.

## 4. Communication Plan (Change Communications)
Effective communication is the backbone of change management:contentReference[oaicite:162]{index=162}. Our plan ensures consistent, frequent, and two-way communication:

**Key Messages:**  
- *Why Change:* Emphasize the rationale – e.g., “This new system will reduce paperwork and free you to focus on service quality.” Tie to departmental mission (“…so we can serve Canadians faster and better.”).
- *Vision of Future:* Describe how the work life will improve: less manual entry, modern tools, easier tracking of requests, etc.
- *Impact on Individuals:* Be transparent about what will change in daily work and what will not. E.g., “Your role as a service agent remains crucial – instead of stamping forms, you’ll review online submissions. The volume you can handle will increase, making your job less repetitive and more client-focused.”
- *Support Available:* Assure them of training, helpdesk support, and that feedback is valued and will be addressed.
- *Recognition:* Acknowledge that change is hard and praise adaptability – build a positive narrative of “we’re doing this together.”

**Communication Vehicles & Schedule:**
- **Kick-off Announcement:** *(When?)* Upon project approval (Gate 3), a message from the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) to all staff in the branch announcing the project. Content: why it’s being done, expected benefits, high-level timeline, and commitment to involve staff. (Date: e.g., email sent on [Month Day, Year]). 
- **Intranet Hub:** A dedicated intranet page launched [Month] with FAQs, project updates, a short video from the Project Sponsor discussing the vision. To be updated monthly.
- **Monthly Newsletter:** Starting [Month], a brief e-bulletin “Project X Update” sent to all impacted staff. Includes progress updates (“what’s been done, what’s next”), spotlight on a team member (e.g., a quote from a change champion about why they’re excited), and a “Did You Know?” addressing common questions or myths.
- **Management Briefings:** Provide team managers with a briefing kit (slides + speaking notes) every two months so they can discuss the change in their regular team meetings. Equip managers to handle basic questions and funnel more feedback upward.
- **Town Hall Meetings:** Two virtual town halls:
  1. Mid-project (design phase, e.g., [Month Year]) – to demo a prototype or screenshots of the new system, gather initial reactions, and show progress. Q&A session included.
  2. Pre-launch (approx 1 month before go-live) – to walk through what will happen on launch, how to get help, and pump up enthusiasm. Led by the DG or ADM to show senior support.
- **Targeted Emails:** 
  - One week before training starts: email to remind staff to attend and highlight training importance.
  - One week before go-live: detailed instruction email – “Here’s what to expect on Monday: how to log in, who to call for help, etc.”
  - Launch day: a celebratory note from the Project Sponsor congratulating on reaching this milestone, encouraging patience as we adjust and thanking everyone for their efforts.
- **Feedback Channels:** 
  - Create an email alias (ProjectX-Feedback@dept.ca) for suggestions or concerns. Promote it in all communications.
  - Anonymous survey after each town hall to gauge sentiments and what questions remain.
  - Change champions act as on-the-ground liaisons: they’ll relay back any unvoiced concerns or rumors so we can address them in communications (e.g., if we hear “people think jobs will be cut,” we address that head-on in the next newsletter with facts).

**Communication Responsibilities:**  
- Change Management Lead drafts and coordinates all comms content (with Comms branch approval on messaging, as required).
- Sponsor and senior management to be visibly involved (e.g., ADM emails, appearing at town halls) to demonstrate commitment.
- Managers at all levels encouraged to echo messages in their meetings – we will supply them with “key message of the month”.
- Two-way: We will respond to every inquiry sent to the feedback email within 2 business days (even if just to acknowledge and then follow-up later with answers).

This plan will ensure everyone hears about the change early and often, and feels their voice can be heard – mitigating uncertainty and building buy-in.

## 5. Training Plan 
Proper training is essential so that staff feel confident using the new system from Day 1:contentReference[oaicite:163]{index=163}. Our training plan includes:

**Training Audience:** Approximately 150 front-line staff and 20 managers/supervisors who will use the new system or oversee its use. Plus, a few technical/support staff who need admin training.

**Training Approach:** 
- **Blended Learning:** We will use a mix of instructor-led live sessions and self-paced e-learning:
  - *Instructor-led (virtual or classroom):* 10 sessions of 15 people each for front-line staff (to allow interaction) – covering system navigation, new workflows, and practice exercises. These will be 3-hour sessions via MS Teams (or in-person in HQ for those on-site, if possible).
  - *Managers’ briefing:* A specialized 2-hour session for managers focusing on monitoring in the new system and how to support their teams through the transition.
  - *E-Learning:* Interactive online modules (30-45 minutes each) for reinforcement: topics like “How to submit a request in System X”, “Approving tasks in System X”. Staff can revisit these anytime.
  - *Job Aids:* Quick reference guides (one-pagers with screenshots for common tasks) and an FAQs document. Hard copies will be provided where useful, and also accessible on the intranet.
- **Timing:** Training will occur ~2-3 weeks before go-live, so knowledge is fresh but there’s still time to address any issues. (Tentative schedule: Training sessions running from Feb 1–14, 2026, with go-live on Mar 1, 2026).
- **Mandatory vs Optional:** All front-line staff are expected to attend one live training. We will track attendance. Managers too. The e-learning is optional but recommended for refreshers and new hires later.
- **Train-the-Trainer:** We’ll identify ~5 “Super Users” (including the change champions and some early adopters) to receive more in-depth training directly from the project team/vendor. These super users will help deliver the main training sessions and act as floor support during the rollout. This builds internal capacity.

**Training Development:** 
- The vendor will help develop training materials for the system functionality (as per contract deliverables). The Change Lead and Business Lead will tailor these materials to our business context and ensure they are bilingual.
- We will test the training content with a small group (maybe some change champions) to ensure it’s effective and clear.

**Post-Training Support:** 
- Establish a temporary “hypercare” support model: for the first month post-launch, have an on-call support team (including IT and a couple of super users) to answer questions in real-time. Possibly set up a dedicated chat channel or hotline during business hours.
- Managers will get a checklist to help them reinforce training on the job (e.g., observing each staff performing a transaction in the new system within first week and checking for issues).
- Follow-up refresher webinar: 1 month after go-live, host a webinar to address any advanced questions or common issues discovered, ensuring any bad habits are corrected early.

**Measuring Training Effectiveness:** 
- We will conduct a pre-training and post-training self-assessment survey. Goal: at least 90% of attendees feel “prepared” or “very prepared” to use the new system after training (from a baseline maybe 30% before training).
- During training sessions, include exercises/quizzes – anyone scoring low will be noted for follow-up (e.g., additional one-on-one coaching).
- Track system usage after launch – e.g., if we see many errors or helpdesk calls in a certain area, that indicates where training might need reinforcement.

By comprehensively training users and giving them resources, we reduce the fear of the unknown and empower staff, thereby increasing acceptance of the change. Well-trained users are more likely to embrace the new process, which is critical for realizing benefits.

## 6. Resistance Management 
Despite best efforts, some resistance to change is expected. We have plans to identify and address resistance proactively:

**Identifying Resistance:** 
- **Surveys & Feedback:** Use the pulse surveys (after comms and training) to gauge sentiments. Look for comments indicating persistent negative feelings.
- **Champion Intel:** Change Champions will report back any rumblings of discontent or misinformation circulating so we can tackle them.
- **Behavioral Indicators:** Post-launch, monitor if some employees are not using the new system or finding workarounds to stick with old ways. Also watch for increased sick leave or turnover in the affected units as potential signs of deeper resistance.

**Addressing Resistance:**  
- **Individual Conversations:** For those individuals or groups showing reluctance, the Change Lead (or their manager) will have direct conversations to understand concerns. Some may just need additional reassurance or training. For instance, if someone is not using the system because they find it confusing, offer one-on-one coaching.
- **Influencer Strategy:** Often, respected peers can influence resisters. We’ll leverage our enthusiastic early adopters to informally encourage colleagues (“peer advocacy”). 
- **Acknowledge and Empathize:** In communications and meetings, openly acknowledge that change can be hard, that mistakes will happen initially, and that that’s okay. Encourage a growth mindset (learning from errors). People often resist less when they feel their feelings are heard and normal.
- **Reinforcement from Leadership:** Ensure managers consistently reinforce the message that this change is the new norm and has leadership backing. If someone tries to bypass the new system, their manager should gently insist on using it and help them do so rather than allowing old methods. Unified messaging prevents pockets of resistance from getting implicit approval.
- **Adjust if Necessary:** If resistance is high because of a legitimate issue (e.g., new system feature causing pain), feed that back to the project for possible tweaks or additional support. Showing that we respond to feedback can turn resisters into neutral or even supporters (“they listened to us and improved X”).
- **Union Involvement:** If any organized resistance or concerns via the union, we’ll meet with them, clarify misunderstandings, and possibly involve them in monitoring fair implementation (e.g., if someone fears job loss, maybe craft an agreement of no layoffs due to this project, if that’s indeed the case, to alleviate fear).

**Worst-case Scenario Plan:** If a subset of users outright refuse or sabotage adoption (rare, but plan for it), we escalate through management chain. For example, one plan: have the sponsor or DG do small group meetings with the holdouts to underscore importance and address issues head-on. In extreme cases, if it affects performance, treat it as a performance issue (with HR guidance) – but that’s last resort; our approach is mainly to **support and persuade, not punish**.

We expect most resistance to soften once users actually try the new system and see benefits (some skeptics become champions when they realize it helps them). Our approach is to convert or mitigate resistance through engagement, not confrontation. And by keeping leadership engaged and showing quick wins, we hope to create a positive momentum that makes resistance socially less prevalent.

## 7. Change Reinforcement & Sustainment
Ensuring the change sticks long-term:
- **Performance Measures:** Tie some performance indicators or objectives to use of the new process. E.g., include a metric in manager performance agreements like “Successful implementation of [Process X] in their team” for the launch year, to incentivize managers to enforce the change.
- **Recognition:** Celebrate successes. After go-live, acknowledge teams or individuals who embraced the change (maybe an internal award or a shout-out in a town hall: “Team A managed to process 100% of requests through the new system within first 2 weeks – great job!”). Positive reinforcement encourages others.
- **Continuous Improvement Mechanism:** Set up a way for users to continuously give feedback on the new system (e.g., a feedback form within the system). This makes them feel invested in making it better, reducing chances of lapse into old ways. Also schedule a post-implementation review meeting focusing on operational feedback at 3-month mark – if small enhancements are needed, plan them. 
- **Policy/Procedure Updates:** Update all relevant standard operating procedures, manuals, and policies to reflect the new process (so there’s no ambiguity that the old way is obsolete). The new process becomes the official way as per documentation.
- **Ongoing Support:** Ensure the helpdesk or support staff remain responsive. If people hit issues and can’t get help, they might abandon the new system.
- **Monitor Benefits:** Track usage metrics: e.g., system logs – are all requests being processed through new system? If some aren’t, find out why (system issue or user workaround?). Also track the outcomes (e.g., did processing time actually drop?) and share these wins: “We are already seeing turnaround drop to 2 weeks, on the way to our 1-week target – thanks to your adoption of the new tool.” Knowing the change is having the promised effect can motivate users to continue using it properly (pride in accomplishment).

- **Leadership Follow-through:** The Sponsor and managers should keep emphasizing the importance of the change even after project close. Avoid the “flavor of the month” syndrome by integrating the new system into regular business rhythms (reports, meetings). When leaders ask for data, they should ask from the new system only, which indirectly forces everyone to use it.

By reinforcing the change, we prevent backsliding. This is crucial in the months after launch when the project team moves on – the business must own the change. The Benefits Realization Plan, owned by the business, is a tool for this sustainment:contentReference[oaicite:164]{index=164}. It will continue to measure and report on usage and benefits, keeping attention on the change until it’s fully institutionalized.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities (Change Management)
- **Project Sponsor (Executive):** Champion the change from the top. Communicate importance at town halls, in emails. Act as “Chief Cheerleader” and also address escalated resistance if needed with authority.
- **Change Management Lead:** (Name) – Coordinates all OCM activities. Develops comms and training, manages change champions, and is the point of contact for any change-related issue. Reports progress on change activities to PM and Steering Committee.
- **Change Champions:** (~10 individuals from various offices/teams) – Act as local advocates. They will:
  - Encourage colleagues, answer questions (after being well briefed).
  - Provide feedback to the Change Lead on morale and issues.
  - Possibly assist in training or testing.
  These champions are chosen for their influence and positive attitude. They meet as a group weekly during critical periods to share insights.
- **Managers/Supervisors:** Front-line managers are key to reinforcing change. They will support their staff by allowing time for training, addressing concerns empathetically, and ensuring compliance with new processes post-launch. We have equipped them with info and expect them to lead by example (e.g., using the new system themselves if applicable, talking positively about it).
- **HR and Communications Departments:** They provide advisory support – Comms reviews messaging for alignment and tone; HR advises on any workforce management issues (if roles change, ensure job descriptions updated appropriately, etc.) and ensures no HR policies are breached by the change.
- **Project Team & IT Support:** While primarily focused on technical delivery, they will be available during training and go-live to help explain technical aspects in plain language. IT support staff specifically will join floor support to resolve issues quickly (technical problems can often be misinterpreted as “the new system is bad” by users, so quick fixes maintain trust).
- **Union Representatives:** Not formal part of project, but we keep them informed. If they raise any issues affecting members, Change Lead and Sponsor will work with them to address fairly.

Everyone has a role in change: from leadership setting the tone to each employee taking personal ownership to learn and adapt. This plan assigns clear responsibilities to ensure no aspect of change is left unattended.

## 9. Timeline of Change Activities
*(Integrate major OCM activities into a timeline relative to project milestones.)*

- **Jan 2024:** *Project Approval (Gate 3)* – Change Lead appointed; initial comms sent (ADM announcement). Stakeholder analysis and readiness survey conducted.
- **Feb–Mar 2024:** Develop detailed Change Management Plan (this document) and get Steering Committee buy-in. Begin periodic communications (newsletters start in March).
- **Apr 2024:** Identify Change Champions and conduct orientation session with them. First town hall held to introduce project team and concept, gather input.
- **Q3 2024:** During design, involve select end-users in design workshops (ensures engagement, reduces resistance). Continue monthly updates.
- **Oct 2024:** Prototype demo to staff (informal show-and-tell session via webinar) – builds awareness and excitement.
- **Jan 2025:** Mid-project Town Hall (project halfway point, share progress and what’s next).
- **Jul 2025:** Begin intensive comms countdown (e.g., “Coming in 6 months: ...”) to prep mindset for upcoming change.
- **Oct 2025:** Conduct second change readiness survey. Results: plan final training and comms push accordingly (if gaps, address in next steps).
- **Dec 2025:** Pre-launch Town Hall (as described) – show final system, walk through what will change on Day 1 of new process. Distribute detailed “Transition Guide” to all.
- **Jan–Feb 2026:** Deliver Training sessions (as per training plan).
- **Mar 2026:** *Go-Live (Gate 4)* – Execute support plan (on-site support, daily stand-ups with champions to resolve issues, daily comms if needed like “Day 2 Tips” email).
- **Mar–Apr 2026:** Reinforcement phase – frequent check-ins. Weekly project newsletter continues for first 4 weeks post-launch sharing positive stories (“X requests processed in new system this week!”) and troubleshooting common questions.
- **May 2026:** *Project Close-Out (Gate 5)* – Officially close project. Send thank-you message from Sponsor to everyone acknowledging the change effort and success.
- **Summer 2026:** 3-month post-launch survey to all users: “How are you feeling about [new system]? What issues remain?” Use results to plan any additional training or system tweaks.
- **Fall 2026:** 6-month benefits check: measure KPIs (e.g., actual turnaround time, etc.) and publish results internally – celebrating improvements attributable to everyone’s adaptation. Also identify any further improvement opportunities or need for refresher training for stragglers.
- **Beyond:** Transition ongoing change support to operational management (the Change Lead hands off responsibilities to the business operations to carry forward, e.g., champions continue in their roles informally, the intranet page stays up for reference).

This timeline ensures change activities are not one-off but spread appropriately from initiation to well after implementation, in line with the principle that change management is an ongoing process:contentReference[oaicite:165]{index=165}.

## 10. Conclusion
Project X’s success depends not just on delivering a new system, but on our people embracing it. This Change Management Plan lays out a comprehensive strategy to achieve that embrace – through clear communication, robust training, and genuine engagement with our staff. By executing this plan, we expect to minimize disruption, turn skeptics into supporters, and realize the full benefits of Project X for the department and the Canadians we serve.

We will continuously adapt this plan based on feedback and changing needs, keeping the well-being and effectiveness of our staff as a top priority during this transformation. Change is a journey, and we are committed to supporting everyone through it.

**Approval:**

**Using the above examples:** These templates demonstrate how PolicyGPT should format and populate various artifacts. When generating an artifact, the assistant should customize these outlines with the project-specific information provided by the user (e.g., replace placeholders with actual project context, adjust number of stakeholders, etc.). The style and content should remain consistent with the exemplars: comprehensive, structured with clear headings, and written in the formal yet accessible tone expected in Government of Canada documentation. 

By following the gate_reference.yaml and these instructions and templates, PolicyGPT will be equipped to draft high-quality, compliant project gating documents that meet TBS guidelines and departmental needs. Each output will be ready for a human project team to review and refine, significantly speeding up the development of these critical governance artifacts.
