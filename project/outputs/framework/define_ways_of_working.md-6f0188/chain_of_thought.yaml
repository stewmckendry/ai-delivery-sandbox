- message: Started with last project's ways_of_working.md as a base. Analyzed 15 retrospective
    docs to extract process insights. Added structured repo folder guidance, versioning
    rules, and stronger delivery practices (logging, lifecycle use, task handoff).
    Highlighted which additions were based on retros. Document structured to balance
    clarity and flexibility across pods.
