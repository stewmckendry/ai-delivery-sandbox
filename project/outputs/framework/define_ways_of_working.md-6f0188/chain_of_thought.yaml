- message: Started with last project's ways_of_working.md as a base. Analyzed 15 retrospective
    docs to extract process insights. Added structured repo folder guidance, versioning
    rules, and stronger delivery practices (logging, lifecycle use, task handoff).
    Highlighted which additions were based on retros. Document structured to balance
    clarity and flexibility across pods.

  lessons:
  - Versioned folders prevent file sprawl.
  - Embedding test+deploy expectations early improves quality.
  - Strong user journey mapping up front improves schema coherence.
  - Reasoning logs and task lifecycle reduce delivery chaos.
- message: Finalized and committed ways_of_working.md. The doc now includes clear
    folder guidance, a practical handoff process, version control clarity, and integration
    with memory/indexing conventions. It reflects learnings from 15 retrospectives
    and aligns team expectations for structure and flow. Iterations clarified roles
    of addendums, version archives, and planning artifacts like user journeys and
    architecture views.
