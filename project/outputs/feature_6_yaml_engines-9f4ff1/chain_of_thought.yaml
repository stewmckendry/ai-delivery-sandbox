- message: 'Finalized the design spec after several key clarifications:

    - Updated pydantic schemas based on real structure of triage_map.yaml and stages.yaml

    - Clarified difference between get_triage_flow and get_triage_question, and when
    assess_concussion is invoked

    - Detailed user journey per engine, mapping upstream/downstream usage

    - Confirmed engines are read-only logic, but their outputs are logged by tools
    to SQLite/Azure SQL per system architecture

    - Schema validator will not relocate YAMLs but validate in-place using models
    in app/models/


    Next step is to begin building triage_engine.py using these inputs.'

    - Created task checklist to track each feature deliverable step

    - Added schema_notes.md to explain what triage_map, tracker_state, and stage_map
    are for, their schema structure, and who uses them

    - This setup ensures we are working front-to-back and not missing any parts of
    the engine pipeline'

- message: Defined triage schema models in app/models/triage.py with full attribute-level
    comments. This provides the type safety and validation backbone for triage_engine
    and future tools that read triage_map.yaml. Confirmed these align 1:1 with the
    YAML structure, and updated task list to reflect this milestone.
