- message: 'Finalized the design spec after several key clarifications:

    - Updated pydantic schemas based on real structure of triage_map.yaml and stages.yaml

    - Clarified difference between get_triage_flow and get_triage_question, and when
    assess_concussion is invoked

    - Detailed user journey per engine, mapping upstream/downstream usage

    - Confirmed engines are read-only logic, but their outputs are logged by tools
    to SQLite/Azure SQL per system architecture

    - Schema validator will not relocate YAMLs but validate in-place using models
    in app/models/


    Next step is to begin building triage_engine.py using these inputs.'
