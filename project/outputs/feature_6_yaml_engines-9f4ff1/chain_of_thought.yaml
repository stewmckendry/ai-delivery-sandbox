- message: "Initiated Feature Area 6 task. YAMLs will be loaded from Git repo directly\
    \ from reference folder. Will use Pydantic for schema enforcement.\n\nFor validation:\n\
    - At runtime, each tool call will validate YAML structure and field presence (for\
    \ resilience).\n- At deploy time (CI), we\u2019ll run a validator script to check\
    \ full schema conformance and changelog presence.\n\nPlanning to separate logic\
    \ by engine:\n- triage_engine.py \u2192 triage flow + risk flags\n- stage_engine.py\
    \ \u2192 stage guidance\n\nThese engines will be invoked by tools like get_triage_flow\
    \ and get_stage_guidance."
