- message: We mapped out a full AI-native architecture for the concussion recovery
    app, taking a systems view across all components and their interactions. This
    includes Custom GPT tooling, FastAPI backend, medical YAMLs, EHR/Azure integration,
    data schemas, security and testing standards, and cloud deployment. We clarified
    YAML access paths and licensing assumptions. This now serves as the foundation
    for specs and implementation planning.
