- message: "After completing the task, we discovered that including the 'content'\
    \ field in the outputs array of manageTaskLifecycle.complete causes file contents\
    \ to be overwritten \u2014 even for files that were already committed through\
    \ previous steps. The output 'content' values were summaries, not full content,\
    \ which wiped all architecture work.\n\nWe manually recovered by resetting to\
    \ the last good commit (e256c9c2...), but this highlights a serious issue in blending\
    \ file commits with task metadata. Going forward, we should separate 'file commits'\
    \ and 'task completions' clearly to preserve fidelity.\n\nIssue logged and RCA\
