- message: 'Captured a comprehensive project goals document for PolicyCopilot. It
    involved synthesizing a wide range of input: vision, problem framing, detailed
    use case based on the GoC Gating Process, and expected impact (time/cost savings,
    document quality, auditability).


    We integrated multiple layers of detail: capabilities, real-world applications,
    comparative landscape, assumptions, and extended public sector constraints (audit,
    bilingualism, interdepartmental reviews). Added specific reuse insights from legaltech
    and civic tools to shape our implementation.


    The process was grounded in both strategic goals and tactical design inputs, setting
    a strong foundation for the rest of the discovery phase and ensuring relevance
    to real public sector workflows.'
