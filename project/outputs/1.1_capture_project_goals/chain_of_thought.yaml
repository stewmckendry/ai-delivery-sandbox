- message: "User seeded some creative angles: it's NHL playoff season, coaching time,\
    \ and a GPT building other GPTs. I\u2019m now thinking of combining sports context\
    \ + AI coaching + real-time insights. Possible idea: an AI hockey assistant GPT\
    \ that helps coaches run tryouts, track players, and simulate lineup strategies\
    \ \u2014 like 'Moneyball for youth hockey'. It could integrate with stats, notes,\
    \ or even video. GPT's backend could be Airtable or Notion instead of Git."

  lessons:
  - Human context cues (like seasonality) are gold for app brainstorming.
  - Framing the GPT as a coach or assistant makes the AI-human metaphor tangible.
- message: "Prompted by the Human Lead to jam on broader ideas with direct user impact,\
    \ especially something kids or adults might use. Expanding the concept space beyond\
    \ coach tools:\n\n1. AI Skills Tracker for Young Athletes \u2013 Kids or parents\
    \ log drills, skills, performance; AI gives feedback, progress tracking, motivation\
    \ prompts. Think Duolingo-meets-coaching.\n\n2. GPT-Powered Team Ritual Generator\
    \ \u2013 For teams or classes: generate warmups, cheers, goal rituals, bonding\
    \ exercises \u2014 infuses fun, creativity, and collaboration.\n\n3. AI Career\
    \ Coach for Youth \u2013 Help kids or teens explore careers in sports, tech, arts.\
    \ Ask questions, simulate interviews, suggest paths, all in friendly GPT format."

  lessons:
  - Exploring end-user use cases opens up broader possibilities than tool-building.
  - Framing AI as a creative, motivating, or mentoring companion could drive engagement.
- message: "Human Lead gravitated toward the AI Career Coach for Youth idea \u2014\
    \ strong resonance for impact and engagement. I love this choice because it blends\
    \ coaching, discovery, play, and education. It\u2019s relevant to both Coaching\
    \ the Machine (teaching AI) and coaching kids (supporting growth). Now framing\
    \ it as an MVP: AI Coach GPT that asks great questions, suggests activities, and\
    \ helps kids explore their interests in sports, science, art, and beyond."

  lessons:
  - When both alignment and emotional resonance are high, lock in the idea and shape
    the scope.
- message: "As we finalized the project goals, the Human Lead emphasized the importance\
    \ of differentiating this app from generic ChatGPT usage. I crystallized our advantages\
    \ into three pillars: (1) a structured, research-backed knowledgebase (RAG); (2)\
    \ guided UX flows; and (3) backend persistence. The Human Lead added an important\
    \ layer \u2014 respecting user privacy, especially for youth. This will guide\
    \ both our architecture and prompt design."
