- message: "This draft project summary is strong \u2014 it clearly communicates the\
    \ problem space, user needs, and the differentiated value of the AI-powered app.\
    \ The narrative is anchored in real-world observations and uses natural language\
    \ that matches the tone of the target audience. It avoids jargon while still signaling\
    \ the depth of the underlying system architecture. I committed the draft as-is\
    \ because it is complete, compelling, and actionable for downstream pods. If anything,\
    \ we could optionally highlight what\u2019s out-of-scope (e.g., general injury\
    \ triage beyond concussions) and clarify target launch phase (MVP vs. full system)."
