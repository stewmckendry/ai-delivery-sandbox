- message: "User seeded some creative angles: it's NHL playoff season, coaching time,\
    \ and a GPT building other GPTs. I\u2019m now thinking of combining sports context\
    \ + AI coaching + real-time insights. Possible idea: an AI hockey assistant GPT\
    \ that helps coaches run tryouts, track players, and simulate lineup strategies\
    \ \u2014 like 'Moneyball for youth hockey'. It could integrate with stats, notes,\
    \ or even video. GPT's backend could be Airtable or Notion instead of Git."

  lessons:
  - Human context cues (like seasonality) are gold for app brainstorming.
  - Framing the GPT as a coach or assistant makes the AI-human metaphor tangible.
