    \ The narrative is anchored in real-world observations and uses natural language\
    \ that matches the tone of the target audience. It avoids jargon while still signaling\
    \ the depth of the underlying system architecture. I committed the draft as-is\
    \ because it is complete, compelling, and actionable for downstream pods. If anything,\
    \ we could optionally highlight what\u2019s out-of-scope (e.g., general injury\
    \ triage beyond concussions) and clarify target launch phase (MVP vs. full system)."

- message: To align with the Human Lead's vision for an end-to-end demonstration of
    GPT + backend integration, I updated the project goals doc to include a clear
    PoC scope. This keeps broad coverage across all major components (EHR, wearables,
    dashboards), but limits depth to simplified, demonstrable examples. The change
    also addresses potential confusion on MVP vs. production scope. Recommitted with
    full preservation of original content plus additions.
