- message: We initiated the Ways of Working by cloning and reviewing the previous
    project's agreement and retrospective. We systematically extracted relevant lessons,
    mapped them to feasible process changes, and updated the original structure without
    altering the framework code. This included changes like logging chain-of-thought
    on each prompt, committing within the `/project/` folder, and providing GitHub
    URLs after each commit. Final touches added more rigor around schema alignment
    and coordination between front-end and back-end. The Human Lead reviewed and approved
    the final version for completion.
