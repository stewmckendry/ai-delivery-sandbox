- message: 'Started by fetching data_flow_master.md and db_models.py to align with
    canonical schema. Added TriageResponse model to db_models.py based on spec: user_id,
    question_id, question_text, answer, timestamp (UTC). Then updated log_incident_detail.py
    to loop over triage answers and insert each as a row in TriageResponse, pulling
    question_text from triage_map.yaml for auditability. Committed each change and
    updated the task tracker to reflect progress.'

- message: Extended data pipeline to include IncidentReport model. Defined model in
    db_models.py with all structured triage fields. Updated log_incident_detail.py
    to populate this row from the answers dict if available. Extended export_to_sql.py
    to write incident_report_export rows to SQL. Updated task tracker to reflect completion
    of schema, logger, and export steps.

- message: Extended pipeline to support structured logging from assess_concussion
    and get_stage_guidance. Added ConcussionAssessment and StageLog models. assess_concussion
    now records red flag evaluations with summary; get_stage_guidance records inferred
    stage per user. Updated both tools and marked related tasks complete in the tracker.

- message: Completed full cleanup of SymptomLog handling. Renamed reserved 'metadata'
    field to 'log_metadata'. Added structured context fields (incident_context, reporter_type,
    etc.). Updated db_writer.py and symptom_logger.py to populate new fields. Added
    SymptomLog to export_to_sql.py. Updated task tracker accordingly.

- message: Created shared symptom_library.py to unify symptom metadata across tools.
    Replaced ad-hoc YAML loading in tools with validated loader. Added audit_symptom_schema
    to validator.py to detect mismatches between logged symptom IDs and YAML definitions.
    Ensured log_incident_detail parses and checks symptoms from triage intake using
    shared loader.

    pod summary, and placeholders for data_flow_master_v2 and tool_catalog_v2. Confirmed
    fallback to IncidentReport is used in symptom_logger. Final handoff next.
