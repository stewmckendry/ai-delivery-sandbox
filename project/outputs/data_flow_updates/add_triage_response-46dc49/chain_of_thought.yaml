- message: 'Started by fetching data_flow_master.md and db_models.py to align with
    canonical schema. Added TriageResponse model to db_models.py based on spec: user_id,
    question_id, question_text, answer, timestamp (UTC). Then updated log_incident_detail.py
    to loop over triage answers and insert each as a row in TriageResponse, pulling
    question_text from triage_map.yaml for auditability. Committed each change and
    updated the task tracker to reflect progress.'
