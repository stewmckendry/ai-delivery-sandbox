- message: Structured the feature document by decomposing the system into foundational
    components and user-facing tools. Ensured all features align with the user journeys
    and implementation specification, including fallbacks, schema-guided drafting,
    bilingual support, audit trails, and evidence search. Each tool now clearly outlines
    its function, inputs, outputs, and process.
