- message: Committed design spec for Feature 2. Defined tools `symptom_logger` and
    `get_stage_guidance`, their schemas, flow context, and DB schema references. This
    connects symptoms.yaml inputs to tracker state and recovery stage output via the
    existing stage_engine. Ready to build schema models next.

- message: Defined and committed `models/symptoms.py` with schemas for check-ins and
    stage inference tools. Added a design addendum explaining how symptoms.yaml metadata
    is used to validate and enrich symptom check-ins (e.g. guidance, risk flags).
    This supports extensible tooling and structured user feedback.

- message: Added get_stage_guidance.py which infers recovery stage using stage_engine.
    Also committed tool_contracts_notes.md to document how we communicate input format
    to Custom GPTs to ensure schema alignment. This guards against bad payloads and
    enables smoother tool calls.
