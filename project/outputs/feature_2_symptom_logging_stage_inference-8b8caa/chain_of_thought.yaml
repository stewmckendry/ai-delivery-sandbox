- message: Committed design spec for Feature 2. Defined tools `symptom_logger` and
    `get_stage_guidance`, their schemas, flow context, and DB schema references. This
    connects symptoms.yaml inputs to tracker state and recovery stage output via the
    existing stage_engine. Ready to build schema models next.
