- message: Defined a structured MVP build backlog to sequence FastAPI routes, utilities,
    schema validation, GPT tool contracts, testing, and deployment setup. This ensures
    alignment with the architecture and helps pace implementation cleanly across system
    layers.

- message: Completed Batch 1 by implementing `/load_prompt` route and loader. Aligned
    the loader to fetch prompt JSON files from GitHub using raw URLs per the deployment
    plan. Validated with live fetch from stewmckendry repo. Code committed after passing
    route tests and verifying error handling.

- message: Completed Batch 2 by implementing `yaml_loader.py` and `/get_yaml_segment`
    route. Loader fetches YAML files from GitHub per category, parses career lists,
    and handles errors gracefully. Verified by fetching STEM segment from stewmckendry
    repo. Code committed successfully.

- message: Completed Batch 3 by implementing /save_reflection route, input schema,
    memory manager, and mock Airtable/Notion clients. Added validation to enforce
    reflection length. Tested with real input and confirmed 422 handling for short
    text.

- message: Completed Batch 4 by implementing /fetch_summary route, summary schema,
    and mock Airtable fetch logic. Summary combines all user reflections per session.
    Tested for both reflection-rich and empty cases.

- message: Completed Batch 5 by integrating Airtable and Notion API clients. Airtable
    uses filtered GET and structured POST to a base/table, while Notion posts structured
    properties to a journal database. All credentials are pulled from `.env` and fail
    gracefully when missing.
