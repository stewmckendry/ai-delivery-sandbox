- message: 'Completed full tooling for Feature 5: dashboard + data export. This included
    implementing `get_triage_question`, `assess_concussion`, building `main.py`, and
    generating a complete OpenAPI schema aligned with GPT integration formats. The
    OpenAPI `paths` were carefully constructed to mirror prior project structure and
    were printed in batches due to file size limits. All scope changes were logged
    and committed into the feature scope tracker and task list. Ready to validate
    data export and dashboard connection next.'
