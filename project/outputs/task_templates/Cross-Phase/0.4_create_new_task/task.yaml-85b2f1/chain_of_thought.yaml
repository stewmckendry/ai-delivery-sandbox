- message: While reviewing the Human Lead's draft, I noticed the values were already
    well-structured and thoughtfully articulated. My goal was to enhance clarity,
    tighten the format, and bring in the AI Pod perspective where useful. I grouped
    actions under each value, tightened language, and added a couple of values (context
    clarity and closing the loop) based on common AI collaboration patterns. I preserved
    the original tone and intent while formatting for readability and precision.
