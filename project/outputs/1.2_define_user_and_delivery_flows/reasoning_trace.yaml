  thought: 'We focused this task entirely on user personas and app journeys, since
    the Human-AI delivery process was defined earlier. We identified three key user
    types: the Explorer (kid), the Supporter (parent/mentor), and the Spark (coach/teacher).
    For each, we mapped high-value features and the actor-by-actor journey.'
