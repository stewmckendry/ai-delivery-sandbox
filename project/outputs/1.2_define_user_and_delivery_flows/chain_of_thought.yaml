- message: "Starting the task to define user and app flows. Given we already defined\
    \ the delivery pod collaboration earlier, I\u2019m focusing purely on end-users.\
    \ I\u2019m imagining a few key personas: (1) a curious middle-schooler exploring\
    \ who they could become, (2) a parent or mentor supporting that journey, and (3)\
    \ a teacher or coach looking to spark reflection in a group setting. From this,\
    \ I\u2019ll define journeys that emphasize agency, exploration, and encouragement."
