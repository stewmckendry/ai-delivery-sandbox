summary: Produced a detailed spec for each MVP feature, linked them to architecture
  scaffolds, and identified deferred experimental items.
task_id: 2.1_design_feature_and_tech_spec
thoughts:
- thought: Mapped each MVP feature to its expected backend endpoint, input/output
    shape, and GPT interaction.
- thought: Cross-referenced spec against implementation scaffolds in the architecture
    folder.
