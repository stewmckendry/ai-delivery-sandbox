- message: We started by organizing features around the GPT Assistant, backend tools,
    integrations (EHR, Azure, wearables), and medical logic. As we reviewed, we clarified
    which tools GPT needs to access via OpenAPI schema and exposed triage/stage logic
    as callable tools rather than backend-only. We iterated the feature table to align
    each function to tools, journeys, and users. Added journey flow mappings, mock
    data schemas, export strategies, and a section on non-functional requirements.
    This sets up implementation and backlog planning cleanly.
