alternatives:
- Could have mocked full OpenAPI spec for GPT tools inline.
- Could use visual cards or Figma to represent features per persona.
improvement_opportunities:
- Include sequence diagrams or visual journey maps.
- Add traceability matrix linking features to goals and personas.

summary: Feature set and architecture designed around GPT call structure and downstream
  data needs. Document provides a clear implementation and backlog foundation.
task_id: 1.3_break_into_features
thoughts:
- thought: Grouped features by GPT, backend, integrations, and tooling for clarity.
    Focused on aligning tools to journeys and outputs.
- thought: Surfaced medical triage and staging logic as callable tools to improve
    modularity and transparency in the architecture.
- thought: Expanded journey maps to detail tool use, conditions, and roles at each
    step.
- thought: Included schemas and structured mock data to support downstream spec work
    and data planning.
