- message: We translated each feature and system from app_features.md into clear acceptance
    criteria covering tool behavior, expected input/output, error handling, and journey
    integration. Identified a missing tool (`assess_concussion`) and replaced a slower
    pattern (`get_triage_question`) with a more conversational approach (`get_triage_flow`).
    Added Apple Health sandbox to the system layer. This sets up automated testing
    and implementation spec tasks cleanly.
