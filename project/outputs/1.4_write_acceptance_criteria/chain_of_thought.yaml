- message: "Drafting acceptance criteria for each feature will focus on observable\
    \ outcomes\u2014e.g., what the user sees, what files are generated, how metadata\
    \ is handled, or whether validation logic is triggered. We\u2019ll draw heavily\
    \ on the functionality/process steps already defined in the feature spec.\n\n\
    We should ensure:\n- Criteria can be tested in isolation or as part of a flow\n\
    - Criteria validate both content quality (structure, tone, alignment) and system\
    \ behavior (commit logs, traceability, etc.)\n- Edge cases are handled, including\
    \ missing inputs, long drafts, or redactions.\n\nSome features like evidence search\
    \ or translation will need criteria across both UX and backend accuracy (e.g.,\
    \ citation relevance, language formatting).\n\nPlan: Go tool by tool from section\
    \ 2 of the features doc, write acceptance criteria for each, then map those back\
    \ to user journeys as sanity check."
