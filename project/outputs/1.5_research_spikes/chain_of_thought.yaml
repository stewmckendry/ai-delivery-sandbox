- message: "**Chain of Thought: YAML Files Creation**\n\n1. **Initial Audit:** Started\
    \ by reviewing prior drafts of the concussion-related YAML files. These included\
    \ `return_to_play.yaml`, `symptoms_reference.yaml`, and `concussion_assessment.yaml`.\
    \ Mapped their contents to the desired structure and identified gaps against SCAT6,\
    \ CDC, and peer-reviewed literature.\n\n2. **Design Principles:** Standardized\
    \ schemas were proposed and confirmed for all files. Key GPT-supportive fields\
    \ (e.g., `id`, `tool_tags`, `symptom_links`, `example_user_utterances`, `response_parsing`)\
    \ were added to ensure smooth parsing, tool interop, and flexible user input handling.\n\
    \n3. **File Splitting:** Due to size and modularity needs, `symptoms.yaml` was\
    \ split into five files (`physical`, `cognitive`, `emotional`, `sleep`, `red_flag`)\
    \ each capturing domain-specific attributes. This improved editability, maintainability,\
    \ and tool targeting.\n\n4. **Metadata Enrichment:** Each symptom entry was expanded\
    \ with full metadata such as severity, risk_level, onset_timing, flags, aliases,\
    \ keywords, and guidance. This semantic richness improves GPT reasoning and triage\
    \ tool accuracy.\n\n5. **Red Flag Readiness:** Symptoms and triage questions related\
    \ to critical risks were marked with structured flags (e.g., `red_flag_check`,\
    \ `triggers_flag`) to support immediate routing or escalation.\n\n6. **Conversational\
    \ Flexibility:** Ensured that triage logic and symptom parsing support non-linear,\
    \ natural dialogue. All structured entries are usable as guidance \u2014 not scripts\
    \ \u2014 allowing GPT to adapt phrasing but remain clinically grounded.\n\n7.\
    \ **Commit Process:** Each YAML file was committed with clear metadata. Committed\
    \ links were logged for reference and shared with the ProductPod for transparency.\n\
    \nFinal files include:\n- `stages.yaml` (revised from return_to_play)\n- `symptoms_*.yaml`\
    \ (split set)\n- `triage_map.yaml` (normalized triage logic)\n\nAll are ready\
    \ for integration into app tooling, reasoning, and FHIR export logic."

    \ Graph**\n\nThis task involved synthesizing clinical best practices into a machine-readable\
    \ format for GPT triage and recovery support. I began by reviewing prior YAML\
    \ drafts and identifying areas for enhancement using authoritative sources: SCAT6,\
    \ CDC HEADS UP, and peer-reviewed literature.\n\nKey phases included:\n- Auditing\
    \ and enhancing all prior YAMLs for schema consistency, clinical accuracy, and\
    \ GPT compatibility\n- Splitting symptoms into domain-specific YAMLs due to size\
    \ and clarity benefits\n- Adding tool-enhancing fields: `response_parsing`, `tool_tags`,\
    \ `symptom_links`, and `example_user_utterances`\n- Designing a normalized triage\
    \ map for flexible, structured intake\n- Writing a full summary document with\
    \ schema details, integration guidance, and source citation\n\nEach step was documented,\
    \ reviewed, and committed to the repo with clean linkage. Task completion submission\
    \ was attempted multiple times but blocked by a backend bug in reasoning trace\
    \ formatting.\n\nFinal files are live and ready for integration into the GPT toolchain\
    \ and UI workflow."
