- message: "**Initial Chain of Thoughts for Task 1.5:**\n\n1. The app design is built\
    \ around a structured decision-making engine using YAML-backed GPT tools. The\
    \ three YAML files \u2014 stages, symptoms, triage map \u2014 serve as the clinical\
    \ backbone for reasoning, symptom flagging, and user guidance.\n2. SCAT6 and CDC\
    \ HEADS UP protocols provide robust clinical grounding for symptoms, flags, and\
    \ stage-based recovery. I'll cross-check each element of the draft YAMLs for alignment\
    \ with these standards.\n3. Output usability is key: schemas will be made consistent,\
    \ category-grouped, and GPT-friendly (e.g., list-style flags, consistent ID keys),\
    \ even if they are not exported to FHIR directly.\n\nNext up: I\u2019ll proceed\
    \ with clinical research and re-authoring each YAML file."

- message: "**Logging Step: Commit of `stages.yaml`, Starting `symptoms.yaml`**\n\n\
    - Committed `stages.yaml` with SCAT6-aligned progression stages, GPT-ready fields\

    - Confirmed with ProductPod that reference YAMLs should serve as *guidance* \u2014\
    \ flexible inputs that GPT uses to structure reasoning and outputs while keeping\
    \ conversation natural. Will include this clarification in the summary doc.\n\
    - Now beginning draft of `symptoms.yaml` with structured categories, red flag\
    \ tagging, and conversational mappings (aliases, user utterances) to support symptom\
