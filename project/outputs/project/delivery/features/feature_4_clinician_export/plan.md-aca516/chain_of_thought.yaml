- message: "Drafted `pdf_renderer.py` and committed file that generates concussion\
    \ summary PDFs using Git-hosted HTML templates. Instead of returning bytes, the\
    \ function now saves to a temp file so `export_summary` can upload and return\
    \ a link. This fits our design pattern and supports file-based delivery through\
    \ the GPT tool.\n\nNext step is building `export_summary.py` which will:\n- Call\
    \ `build_fhir_bundle()`\n- Call `render_pdf()`\n- Upload the PDF file\n- Return\
    \ OpenAPI-typed response with PDF link + FHIR bundle\n\nWe\u2019ll also define\
    \ its Pydantic model and test in `test_export_summary.py`."

- message: Completed and committed `export_summary.py`, the main FastAPI tool that
    bundles PDF + FHIR export. Stubbed cloud upload and wired it to call `build_fhir_bundle()`
    and `render_pdf()`. Also added `export_flow_notes.md`, an addendum that documents
    the entire export process, including file locations, inputs, and modular tool
    flow. This reinforces traceability and makes onboarding easier for future pods.
