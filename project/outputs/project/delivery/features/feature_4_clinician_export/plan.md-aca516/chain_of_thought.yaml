- message: "Drafted `pdf_renderer.py` and committed file that generates concussion\
    \ summary PDFs using Git-hosted HTML templates. Instead of returning bytes, the\
    \ function now saves to a temp file so `export_summary` can upload and return\
    \ a link. This fits our design pattern and supports file-based delivery through\
    \ the GPT tool.\n\nNext step is building `export_summary.py` which will:\n- Call\
    \ `build_fhir_bundle()`\n- Call `render_pdf()`\n- Upload the PDF file\n- Return\
    \ OpenAPI-typed response with PDF link + FHIR bundle\n\nWe\u2019ll also define\
    \ its Pydantic model and test in `test_export_summary.py`."

- message: Completed and committed `export_summary.py`, the main FastAPI tool that
    bundles PDF + FHIR export. Stubbed cloud upload and wired it to call `build_fhir_bundle()`
    and `render_pdf()`. Also added `export_flow_notes.md`, an addendum that documents
    the entire export process, including file locations, inputs, and modular tool
    flow. This reinforces traceability and makes onboarding easier for future pods.

- message: 'Marked all testing tasks complete in task list. Full coverage now includes:

    - Unit validation of FHIR structure (`test_fhir_schema.py`)

    - PDF generation and file assertions (`test_pdf_renderer.py`)

    - Integration flow test for the full tool (`test_export_summary.py`)


    These confirm contract compliance and real-data output for the `export_summary`
    tool. We now move into delivery validation and closeout steps.'
