    \ app supports temporary in-session memory (favorites, reflection) and optional\
    \ persistent backend (Airtable/Notion). It emphasizes privacy, simplicity, and\
    \ high delight. Career content is categorized into themes like STEM, Creatives,\
    \ Builders, etc. The system must support dynamic YAML grounding, structured GPT\
    \ prompting, and optionally journaling persistence. UX must be fun, visual, and\
    \ mobile-friendly. Users include kids (explorers), mentors, and teachers (sparks)."
