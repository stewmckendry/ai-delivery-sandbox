- message: "Based on the files reviewed, the AI Career Coach is a GPT-powered app\
    \ for youth aged 9\u201314 that uses a friendly, structured coaching model to\
    \ explore careers. The core experience revolves around playful prompts, guided\
    \ Q&A, and career suggestions grounded in a YAML-based knowledgebase (RAG). The\
    \ app supports temporary in-session memory (favorites, reflection) and optional\
    \ persistent backend (Airtable/Notion). It emphasizes privacy, simplicity, and\
    \ high delight. Career content is categorized into themes like STEM, Creatives,\
    \ Builders, etc. The system must support dynamic YAML grounding, structured GPT\
    \ prompting, and optionally journaling persistence. UX must be fun, visual, and\
    \ mobile-friendly. Users include kids (explorers), mentors, and teachers (sparks)."

- message: "To design the architecture, I\u2019m centering the flow around a structured\
    \ Prompt UI frontend, a GPT API layer that loads grounding context from YAML segments\
    \ (RAG), and optional journaling persistence via Airtable or Notion. Given the\
    \ YAMLs are thematically organized, we can dynamically load categories based on\
    \ user input. Data flow must preserve context during Q&A while keeping the session\
    \ lightweight and private. This separation also allows us to modularize memory\
    \ (local/session vs. cloud-persisted). I will diagram both the in-session loop\
    \ and the optional persistence extension."
