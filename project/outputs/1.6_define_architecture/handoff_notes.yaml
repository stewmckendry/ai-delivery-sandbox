  reason: The discovery phase (goals, flows, features, research) is complete. Time
    to define the system architecture that will bring the GPT Career Coach to life.
  token_count: 0
  next_prompt: Design the system architecture for the AI Career Coach app. Define
    how the GPT, frontend, backend (for memory), and RAG YAML grounding will integrate.

  notes: 'Architecture should support:

    - Prompt selector UI and Q&A flow

    - GPT integration with structured prompts

    - RAG-based grounding from YAML segments

    - Option to persist user reflections (via Notion, Airtable, or similar)

    - Option to segment career content by category for exploration

    Output should include an architecture diagram and system description.'
  ways_of_working: Commit all outputs to Git. Log chain of thought. Complete task
