- message: 'All discovery spikes completed:


    1. **Epic FHIR**: Identified how to register apps and use Client ID for token
    access, pending app approval flow from Epic Dev Portal.

    2. **Power BI Dashboard**: Designed staging schema and filters for tracking incidents,
    stages, and compliance. Azure SQL export is core.

    3. **YAML Inference**: GPT should preload structured logic from YAML files and
    reason conversationally through it using tools like `get_triage_flow`.

    4. **Session Memory**: Recommends using tracker code and optional magic link.
    GPT should store tracker ID in memory when available.


    Collectively, these spikes de-risk critical flows: user continuity, system dashboarding,
    clinical export, and AI reasoning logic. We''re now ready to transition into implementation.


    Next: backlog grooming and task sequencing for build phase.'
