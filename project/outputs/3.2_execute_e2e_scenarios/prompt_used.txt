ðŸ“© QA Task Kickoff â€“ Task 3.2_execute_e2e_scenarios

Goal: Simulate full user journeys through the CareerCoach MVP using the CareerCoach-GPT custom GPT interface. Tests should validate the real user experience, not API endpoints directly.

Focus: Explorer and Mentor (Supporter) flows, testing prompt loading, journaling, segment selection, saving reflections, and reviewing summaries â€” all via GPT calls.

Tools to validate:
- load_prompt
- get_yaml_segment
- record_reflection
- fetch_summary

Data stores:
- Notion: rich journaling log
- Airtable: metadata for session analysis and prompt tracking
