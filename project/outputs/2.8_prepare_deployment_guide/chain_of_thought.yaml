- message: 'Prepared a complete deployment guide covering the full system stack: FastAPI
    (Railway), Azure SQL, Blob storage, Power BI, and Swagger. Included detailed steps
    for setting up each component, running locally, configuring env vars, and validating
    all endpoints. Also created a Custom GPT Setup guide that defines its tools, logic
    sequence, system instructions, and tone. Recommitted both guides with full content
    due to size/redaction limits. Confirmed OpenAPI alignment, system flow, and GPT
    behavior expectations.'

    revealed that ''uvicorn'' is not included in requirements.txt. This is needed
    for FastAPI app startup, so we''ll add it to the dependencies and recommit.'

- message: Deployment failed due to missing TrackerMetadata model. This model is referenced
    in log_incident_detail.py but was never defined. Design docs suggest it should
    track triage metadata for export. Defined a TrackerMetadata model and will commit
    it to db_models.py to resolve the issue.
