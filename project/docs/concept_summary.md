# Concept Summary: Patient-Centered Health Data Co-Pilot

## Vision
Empower patients to become the gateway to their own integrated health data. By leveraging the access they already have to various healthcare portals (e.g., hospitals, family doctors, specialists), the app automates aggregation, structuring, and interpretation of medical information through AI.

## Core Features (PoC Scope)
1. **User Portal Integration**
   - Users input credentials for multiple health portals.
   - App authenticates and scrapes data/documents.

2. **Data Structuring**
   - Clean and normalize scraped text and documents.
   - Structure information across portals into unified views.

3. **AI-Powered Understanding**
   - Chat-based interface to ask health-related questions.
   - Summary generation, report creation, and data explanations.

## Why Now?
- Rising patient expectations for data access and personalization.
- Persistent failure of centralized health record initiatives.
- Maturity of AI tools for web automation, NLP, and summarization.

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Authentication barriers** → Support initial manual 2FA + adaptive scraping.
- **Data privacy** → End-to-end encryption and local-first processing.
- **Data variety** → Use LLMs to align different formats and terminologies.
- **Accuracy** → Transparency features and clinical review options.

## Next Steps
- Select 1–2 target portals for PoC.
- Build scraping, structuring, and chat MVP.
- Test with real (anonymized) patient accounts.
