# 🧠 Phase 1 Retrospective – AI Health Records Copilot

## 🏁 Objective
Build a GenAI-native app that empowers patients to access and understand their health data across multiple portals — via scraping, summarization, and LLM-based question answering.

## ✅ What We Delivered

### 🔄 Data Pipeline
- Scrapers for mock portals (`test_portal`, `test_portal_b`) using Playwright
- Extraction (rule-based + LLM)
- Summarization, deduplication, and storage into structured tables
- Credential management + challenge handler (MFA, CAPTCHA)
- Logging + audit trail + consent capture

### 🧠 AI Integration
- Used OpenAI to classify, summarize, and respond to questions
- Prompt templating with YAML loaders
- RAG-style `/ask` API + CLI tool

### 📤 Outputs
- Export tool (Markdown, JSON, PDF)
- Summary generator per portal run
- Full logs and audit trails

## 🧪 Test Runs
- ✅ Test Run 1: `test_portal`
- ✅ Test Run 2: `test_portal_b`
  - ETL, export, and ASK tool all verified

## 🔍 Lessons Learned
- `.env` management was critical (especially with DATABASE_URL overrides)
- ODBC connection and password encoding were common friction points
- Logs and summaries helped ensure traceability and transparency

## 📦 Repos + Branches
- **Repo:** `ai-delivery-sandbox`
- **Branch:** `sandbox-curious-fox`

## 📁 Key References
- `/project/docs/` – concept, system design, alignment, checklist
- `/task_guides/reports/` – completed tasks and test runs
- `/scripts/` – run, export, ask tools
- `/app/` – core logic folders: `adapters`, `processors`, `storage`, `api`

## 🚀 What’s Next
- Enable real portal scraping with human-in-the-loop auth
- Polish output formatting (PDFs, summaries)
- Integrate with ChatGPT via MCP for conversational UI
- Add schema validation or export to FHIR for healthcare alignment

## 🙌 Team Model
- Human (Liam) sets direction + test + unblock
- ProductPod (ChatGPT) organizes, codesigns, validates
- Codex Agents implement tasks in repo

Great momentum and a solid MVP — ready for scale and polish!
