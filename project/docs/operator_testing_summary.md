# 🧪 OpenAI Operator Testing Summary

## 🎯 Why Use Operator
The Operator is a secure, AI-assisted browser that allows users to navigate health portals themselves while getting help from an LLM. It enables:
- Guided login + navigation
- Data retrieval from sites without APIs
- Secure file export (HTML, PDF) under user control
- Better UX than coding scrapers or manual data entry

## ✅ User Flow
1. **User launches Operator from Copilot**
2. **Takes over for login and consent steps**
3. **Requests Operator to retrieve data** (e.g., lab results, exercise history)
4. **Operator finds and saves HTML snapshot to /home/oai/share**
5. **User uploads file to Azure Blob for downstream ETL and RAG use**

## 🔍 Sites Tested
| Site            | Status     | Notes |
|------------------|------------|-------|
| TeamSnap         | ✅ Chrome only | Safari login blocked |
| Garmin Connect   | ❌ Blocked by Cloudflare anti-AI bot |
| Strava           | ⚠️ Partial | reCAPTCHA errors at login; HTML export worked |

## 🔐 Export Findings
- ✅ HTML export works reliably (Chrome ▸ Save Page As…)
- ❌ CSV/TXT export blocked (no terminal or write perms)
- ❌ PDF print dialog blocked on some sites
- ✅ Screenshot + local print is fallback for OCR use

## 📁 Security
- Files stored only in `/home/oai/share` for session duration
- No public uploads unless user opts in (e.g., Pastebin)
- User confirms every save and download

## 🚧 Limitations
- No terminal access → can't generate new files (e.g., via Python)
- Some browser features disabled (Print, Screenshot tools)
- CAPTCHA and Cloudflare block automation on some portals
- No persistent storage — session wiped after close

## 📈 Impact Assessment
We **still have a compelling user-facing product** because:
- Users can **retrieve unstructured health info** that would otherwise be inaccessible
- Operator lets them do it **securely, under their control**
- HTML snapshots are **RAG-compatible** after extraction + structuring

It’s better than status quo (no export, no scraping, poor UX), even with constraints.

## 🔮 Outlook
- Sandbox constraints may ease (e.g., PDF support, terminal)
- Cloudflare & CAPTCHA blocking are unlikely to improve
- HTML + manual PDF capture is best current path
