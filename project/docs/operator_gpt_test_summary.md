## 🧠 What We Did

### 1. **Collected Health Records**  
Using **OpenAI Operator**, we securely accessed and collected personal health records under full user control and consent from:
- ✅ A **personal health app** (e.g., Strava)
- ✅ A **lab provider** (LifeLabs)
- ✅ A **hospital portal** (Unity Health Toronto MyChart)

### 2. **Uploaded to Secure Cloud**  
- Files were uploaded via a **signed SAS URL** to **Azure Blob Storage**
- No credentials were stored, and uploads were under user supervision

### 3. **Processed the Data**  
- Uploaded files were structured via a FastAPI ETL pipeline:
  - Extracted from HTML/PDF
  - Cleaned and parsed (labs, visit summaries, notes)
  - Stored securely for session use only

### 4. **Asked Questions with ChatGPT**  
Using the **MyHealth Copilot GPT**, we queried structured health data:
- “Can you explain my lab results?”
- “When and why did I go to the Emergency Department?”
- “How has my physical activity been?”

GPT responded using `/ask`, grounded in structured session data.

### 5. **Exported a PDF Summary**  
- Used `/export` to generate a formatted report (labs, visits, structured notes)
- Shared-ready as a PDF for **clinician or care team review**

## ✅ Outcome
This successful end-to-end test proves that **GenAI can now operate securely and meaningfully over real-world personal health data**, empowering users to:
- Access and understand records from multiple systems
- Retain full control and privacy
- Use AI to surface insights and prepare summaries

**A personal AI health assistant is no longer hypothetical — it’s here.**
