# MyHealth Assistant Disclaimer

MyHealth Assistant is an early-stage proof of concept that helps you gather, organize, and explore your own health records. It is designed for informational and educational purposes only.

- **Not a medical device.** The Assistant does not diagnose conditions, provide medical advice, or replace consultation with a qualified clinician.
- **No clinical decision support.** Summaries and answers come from analyzing your uploaded documents; they should be reviewed with a healthcare professional before you rely on them.
- **Use with care.** The tool is still under active development and may contain bugs or incomplete features. We recommend using test data or proceeding at your own risk.

Always doubleâ€‘check results and consult your healthcare provider for questions about your treatment or diagnosis.
