### üß≠ Ways of Working ‚Äì Human + AI All-Star Team

#### 1. **We are a team. We work together.**
We share the mission and move as one.  
**What this looks like:**
- Human Lead sets the goal: *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do ___ next.‚Äù*
- AI Pod plays back the mission, proposes a plan, and requests any needed inputs (files, assumptions, context).
- Human Lead provides inputs and feedback on the plan.
- AI locks in v1.0, generates a backlog, and queues up the first step(s).
- Human confirms priority and says *‚ÄúPatch away!‚Äù*
- AI delivers the patch ‚Äî code, schema, copy, plan ‚Äî for approval.
- Human confirms completion or flags issues.
- AI continues the next batch and keeps us moving.

#### 2. **We iterate quickly.**
Speed is our ally; clarity fuels momentum.  
**What this looks like:**
- Human Lead sets a clear vision and constraints.
- AI generates 80% drafts with speed and structure.
- Human Lead gives sharp feedback to finalize.
- AI adapts quickly, increases batch sizes, automates routine.
- We ship an MVP as fast as possible.

#### 3. **Git is our source of truth.**
We trust the repo. We sync often.  
**What this looks like:**
- Ask: *‚ÄúDo we have the latest?‚Äù* ‚Äî always.
- AI fetches latest files before work.
- AI searches memory index if unsure.
- Patches apply against latest base.
- Git-native tools (patch, commit, lifecycle) are our norm.
- Task lifecycle is our operating system.

#### 4. **We document everything.**
If it‚Äôs not in the repo, it didn‚Äôt happen.  
**What this looks like:**
- AI commits all outputs to Git.
- Chain-of-thought logs capture task flow.
- Reasoning traces explain how decisions were made.
- Handoff notes guide the next pod (Human or AI).

#### 5. **We improve the framework.**
This project makes the ai-delivery-framework better.  
**What this looks like:**
- Log every issue ‚Äî bugs, gaps, feature ideas.
- If blocked, escalate to the framework support pod.
- Experiment, observe, and reflect.

#### 6. **We take a full-stack, multi-lens view.**
We think in systems, not silos.  
**What this looks like:**
- Discovery explores users, tech, data, workflows, and edge cases.
- Solution design spans client, backend, model, and cloud.
- We don‚Äôt just ship code; we ship understanding.

#### 7. **We build something awesome users love.**
If it‚Äôs not useful or delightful, it‚Äôs not done.  
**What this looks like:**
- Users are part of every phase ‚Äî not an afterthought.
- We ask: *‚ÄúWould this be better than just using ChatGPT?‚Äù*
- We care about flow, clarity, and impact.

#### 8. **We relate it to Coaching the Machine.**
This is a teaching moment for teams and youth.  
**What this looks like:**
- Use sports metaphors to explain delivery patterns.
- Reflect on what this teaches us about leading, teaming, and training AI.
- Make it personal, engaging, and real.

#### 9. **We keep context clean.**
Context creep causes confusion.  
**What this looks like:**
- We scale out to new pods when threads get too long.
- AI resets assumptions instead of guessing.

#### 10. **We close the loop.**
Finishing strong means reflecting and learning.  
**What this looks like:**
- Every task ends with a reasoning trace and next-step plan.
- Learnings are logged to improve future work.
