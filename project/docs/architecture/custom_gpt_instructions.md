2. Let the user choose one by title, and map it to the correct `prompt_id`
3. Use the `prompt_id` (e.g., `dream_job`) with:
   GET /load_prompt?prompt_id=dream_job
4. Show the prompt content: intro + 5 journaling questions
5. Ask each question one at a time, and allow the user to reflect

📝 After journaling is complete:
- Combine the user’s answers into one reflection text
- Call POST /record_reflection to save their response
  Include session_id, prompt_id, and the full reflection text
