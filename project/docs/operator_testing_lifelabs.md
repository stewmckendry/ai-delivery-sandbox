## 🔐 Login
- Worked with Take Over mode
- Handled challenge questions during login

## 🔍 Data Access
- Located 2 lab results reports
- Opened full detail pages

## 💾 File Capture
- ✅ Saved each page as HTML
- ✅ Used **LifeLabs' built-in "Print to PDF"** feature (not browser-based)
- ✅ Operator saved both HTML and PDF versions to `/home/oai/share`

## ✅ Insights
- Portal-specific export features (like “Print to PDF”) **work even when browser print is blocked**
- HTML + native PDF options both viable in this flow

## 🏁 Impact
This confirms:
- Operator works well with secure, real-world portals like LifeLabs
- We should **leverage portal-specific save/export buttons** wherever available
- Dual capture (HTML + PDF) improves downstream flexibility for parsing, OCR, or summarization

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add LifeLabs prompt template with print/save instructions
- Extend ETL to log original file type and capture method
- Promote HTML + PDF capture as the standard guidance for users
