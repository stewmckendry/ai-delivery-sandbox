## Case Study: Building the Youth Career Coach with `ai-delivery-framework`

### 🔧 Project Overview
**Goal:** Test the feasibility, utility, and rigor of the `ai-delivery-framework` by building a real-world MVP—an AI-powered career coach for youth aged 9–14.

**Duration:** 4 Phases, ~3 weeks

**Outcome:** 50+ career entries, 10 journaling prompts, 4 tested endpoints, dual memory backend, structured RAG, and full E2E deployment

---

### 🧭 Chronology – What Happened
1. **Sandbox Kickoff:** We initialized a clean workspace (`sandbox-silent-otter`) using the framework’s branching system.
2. **Ways of Working:** Defined async pods, reasoning logs, and handoff notes to ensure smooth transitions.
3. **Discovery:** We explored user journeys, defined personas (Explorer, Mentor, Spark), and mapped product flows.
4. **Prompt + RAG Design:** Created and structured YAML-based knowledgebooks with career metaphors. Delivered 10 youth-friendly journaling prompts.
5. **Architecture Design:** Defined a GPT-first stack using Custom GPT frontend + FastAPI backend. Drafted specs and OpenAPI.
6. **Build Phase:** Implemented loaders, endpoints, schema validation, memory integration (Notion + Airtable).
7. **E2E Testing:** Validated Explorer flows, segment fetch, and journaling pipelines using GPT simulations.
8. **Deployment:** Finalized `.env`, CI setup, route wiring, and patch logs.

### 📦 Changelog Summary
From the `changelog.yaml`:
- 40+ outputs committed across discovery, build, test
- Clear task-to-output traceability (e.g., 3.2_execute_e2e_scenarios → test results, handoffs, retros)

---

### 🧠 Memory Summary
From `memory.yaml`:
- **Volume:** 50+ files committed, each tagged and versioned
- **Richness:** Covers architecture, prompts, YAML loaders, retrospectives, specs, client modules
- **Roles:** Memory spans across pods (DeliveryPod, DevPod, ResearchPod, PromptPod, QAPod)

---

### 🧠 How We Thought – Decisions and Reasoning
**Chain of Thought:**
- Used for each pod to log assumptions, validations, learnings
- Example: PromptPod logged a real bug about defaulting to `main` → fixed with branch patching

**Reasoning Traces:**
- Captured design choices (e.g., structured YAML, deferred features)
- Highlighted improvement opportunities, like chunking large YAML files

**Retrospectives:**
- Reflected on async flow, value of structured handoffs, RCA practices
- Learned to split deployment logic from GPT tool logic to avoid API breaks

---

### 🏗️ System Design Snapshot
- **Frontend:** Custom GPT + Explorer flows
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Tools:** Prompt loader, YAML segment fetcher, memory saver, summary generator
- **Memory:** Dual backend—Notion and Airtable
- **Deployment:** Railway + CI checklist

### ✨ Quotes from the Project
> “We structured YAML into segments to avoid silent commit truncation—small fix, big save.”  
> “Framing research as product-building clarified its value and unblocked downstream GPT logic.”  
> “Reflection save was failing due to a route-level bug. Fixed by unpacking the dict. Passed validation.”

### 🎯 Outcomes
- ✅ 50+ career entries in metaphor-rich YAML
- ✅ 10 age-friendly journaling prompts
- ✅ 4 tested endpoints (prompt, segment, reflection, summary)
- ✅ Dual memory working across Notion + Airtable
- ✅ E2E validated with GPT tool simulations
