## Coaching the Machine: Reimagining Delivery with AI

### I. From Copy-Paste Fatigue to Delivery Insight

It started, as many tech adventures do, with excitement — generating thousands of lines of code with ChatGPT and asking GitHub Copilot for help. But switching between tabs and trying to keep context alive across sessions wasn't exciting — it was exhausting. It felt like bouncing between customer service reps in a call centre. Frustrating. Repetitive. Inefficient.

That’s when it hit me: I was trying to be a developer (and not a good one!). I'm used to leading 80+ person teams delivering complex enterprise systems — orchestrating architects, developers, testers, and analysts. So naturally, the question arose: what does delivery look like when some of your team are AI agents?

### II. The Thunder Train

This insight collided with another world I live in — coaching my son’s rep hockey team. Tryouts just wrapped. We had to say goodbye to some players and welcome new ones. It’s always tough. But in our first team talk, we laid out a shared vision: we’re not just a collection of talented individuals — we’re building the Thunder Train. Each player is a car, strong on their own, but powerful only when connected and moving in sync.

That’s what delivery looks like. And that’s what I wanted from AI.

### III. Designing a Framework for AI-Native Delivery

So I built one: the **AI Delivery Framework**. A way to turn that Thunder Train vision into something real — a system where AI agents (called GPT Pods) collaborate with humans to deliver real-world outcomes. Apps, yes. But potentially anything.

**Here’s how it works:**
