## 📢 Case Study (Non-Technical Version)
**Title:** *How We Built an AI Career Coach for Kids Using Pods, Prompts, and a Playground*

### 🌟 Overview
We used a new system called `ai-delivery-framework` to build a real working app: a friendly AI that helps kids explore future careers. In just **one day** (spread over small pockets of time), we designed it, built it, tested it, and shipped it. All using a sandbox and a pod-based process.

**Why this matters:** This case study shows how the framework makes it easier for teams to work with AI—by breaking big ideas into clear steps, with helpful handoffs between humans and AI.

### 🧩 What We Built
- **CareerCoach-GPT:** A custom GPT that guides kids through fun prompts about dream jobs
- **50+ Career Paths:** From Space Vet to Nature Spy, written in kid-friendly language
- **10 Journaling Prompts:** Designed for ages 9–14, encouraging self-reflection and creativity
- **Interactive Backend:** Smart software to load prompts, remember responses, and show summaries
- **Dual Memory:** It remembers using tools like Notion and Airtable

---

### 🛠️ How We Did It
1. **We started a sandbox** — our private playground called `sandbox-silent-otter`
2. **Defined how we’d work** — with async updates, handoffs, and logs
3. **Explored the users** — like the Explorer (a kid), the Spark (a teacher), and the Mentor (a parent)
4. **Created prompts and content** — using metaphor-rich stories and fun writing prompts
5. **Built the software** — one clear task at a time, from fetching data to saving memories
6. **Tested end-to-end** — simulating what a real kid might do in the app
7. **Deployed it live** — with helpful guides, environment setup, and integration checks

### 📈 What the Framework Helped Us Do
- **Stay Organized:** Each team or "pod" had a clear job
- **Track Progress:** We saved notes, thoughts, and files automatically
- **Catch Mistakes:** We logged bugs and fixed them fast
- **Keep Learning:** Every task ended with a short reflection or "what we learned"

### 💬 What Team Members Said
> "We turned big goals into small wins—with prompts, YAML, and lots of trust."

> "Every handoff made it feel like passing a baton in a relay—we never dropped the project."

> "Even when something broke, we learned, fixed, and kept going. That’s the framework in action."
