## 🔁 Task 2.8 Retrospective – Build, Deployment & Test Stabilization

### ✅ Summary of Scope
This task finalized the MVP backend by ensuring all endpoints were implemented, tested, and deployed successfully. It also addressed gaps in schema alignment, tool integration, and API security wiring for a production-ready GPT interface.

### 🧠 What Was Completed
- 🏗 Built and patched all FastAPI routes: `/load_prompt`, `/record_reflection`, `/get_yaml_segment`, `/fetch_summary`
- 🔐 Integrated JWT-based security for custom GPT tools
- 🔄 Connected and tested both **Notion** and **Airtable** for dual-write reflection logging
- 📤 Successfully deployed to Railway with correct environment variables, tokens, and root path config
- 🧪 Tested all tools via GPT:
  - Reflection logging
  - Summary retrieval
  - Prompt and segment loading
- 🪛 Logged and resolved all integration bugs
- 📘 Documented system-wide deployment, schema flows, and unit test results

### 🐞 Why So Many Bugs?
| Root Cause | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Parallel development | FastAPI routes and prompt loaders were built before prompt structure and database schemas stabilized |
| Schema drift | Airtable and Notion field names/types didn't match what the API expected |
| Undocumented loaders | Prompt JSON changed (added `content` block), but dependent logic wasn't updated |
| Manual config gaps | Table names, environment variables, and tokens weren't consistently verified in early commits |

### 🧰 What Helped
- Quick test feedback via GPT tool runs
- Curl + Railway logs for Airtable and Notion debugging
- Precise schema checks in test files
- Standardized `.env.template` and deployment checklists

### 🛡️ What We'll Do Better Next Time
| Fix | How We'll Apply It |
|-----|-------------------|
| Schema freeze before build | Add schema validation CI step before API and prompt work begins |
| Airtable/Notion schema contract | Document field names and types in advance in `specs` folder |
| Prompt and segment examples early | Include real prompts and YAML segments before testing tools |
| Validate tools via Postman first | Run endpoint tests before GPT tool wiring |
| Fetch-edit-commit discipline | Always fetch latest files before patching

### ✅ Outcome
CareerCoach backend is stable, dual-write ready, and test-covered. We now hand off to QAPod to simulate full user journeys.

### 📩 Handoff Note to QAPod
**From Pod:** ProductPod  
**To Pod:** QAPod  
**Task:** Task 3.2_execute_e2e_scenarios  
**Branch:** `sandbox-silent-otter`  

#### Scope
Run end-to-end tests simulating Explorer and Mentor journeys. Validate backend behavior via GPT tools and API responses.

#### Ready-to-Test Features:
- Load journaling prompts via `load_prompt`
- Submit reflections via `record_reflection` (Notion + Airtable)
- Get matched career card via `get_yaml_segment`
- Fetch saved journaling reflection via `fetch_summary`

#### Reference Files:
- `project/specs/openapi.yaml` (API contract)
- `project/inputs/prompts/prompts.json`
- `project/docs/architecture/data_store_explainer.md`
- `tests/unit_test_summary.md`

#### Known Gaps
- Career segment matching is static (no inference logic yet)
- No frontend error handling (GPT only)

#### Next Steps
- Design test scenarios based on Explorer/Coach journeys
- Confirm data lands in Notion & Airtable
- Report success/failures and propose QA logging format
