## 🔍 Discovery Phase Retrospective – CareerCoach Project

### ✅ What We Accomplished
- **Defined full system architecture**: Custom GPT frontend, FastAPI backend, YAML RAG, dual memory
- **Delivered all critical artifacts**: diagrams, tech stack, loaders, prompt tools, OpenAPI schema
- **Deployment-ready**: Railway hosting, CI/CD plan, session design, rollback process
- **Tech quality standards**: testing, logging, schema versioning, graceful fallback
- **Process resilience**: detected and recovered from critical overwrite incident

---

### 🧠 What Went Well
- Seamless pivot to Custom GPT-first architecture — matched user needs and delivery speed
- Deep iteration with version-controlled architecture artifacts
- Great documentation habits — system prompt, session logic, loaders, and deployment
- Strong alignment with ai-delivery-framework values: modularity, testability, traceability

---

### 🛠 What Could Be Improved (Framework)
- 🐞 **Task Completion Output Risk**: Overwriting files unintentionally due to unclear API behavior
- 🧭 **Task ID Discoverability**: Hard to recall or autocomplete task names when completing
- ⛓ **Memory-Safe Commits**: Should separate file writing from task state to prevent accidents
- 🧪 **Testing Templates**: Would help to scaffold FastAPI route test coverage from task metadata

---

### 🌱 What’s Next
- DevPod to begin implementation of scaffolded modules
- Extend Custom GPT prompt and polish tool schema
- Prep for blog post walkthrough of ai-delivery-framework applied to a youth product

We are well positioned for a smooth build phase — thoughtful, playful, and delivery ready.
