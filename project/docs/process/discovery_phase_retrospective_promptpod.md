## üîç PromptPod Retrospective ‚Äì Discovery Phase (AI Career Coach)

### ‚úÖ What Went Well
- **Rhythmic collaboration with Human Lead**: Clear delegation, feedback, and iteration made discovery smooth and energizing.
- **Values-driven kickoff**: Creating our "Ways of Working" up front aligned the team on behavior, communication, and tooling.
- **Precise task execution**: We committed every doc and tool call with clarity, which made the entire discovery phase reusable.
- **Structured MVP design**: Flows, features, and acceptance criteria were broken into testable units early.
- **Strong RAG preparation**: Our handoff to ResearchPod delivered a clean, scoped research objective with context, references, and formatting expectations.

### üß† What Could Be Improved
- **Task ownership model**: Framework didn't allow us to assign a task directly to another pod (e.g., ResearchPod or ProductPod). Had to use workarounds.
- **Changelog conflicts**: We frequently hit commit errors due to stale changelog.yaml conflicts. A pre-commit fetch or auto-merge mode might help.
- **Handoff automation**: Handing off across pods required multiple calls. A single `handoff_and_assign` helper might streamline this.

### üí° Framework Ideas
- Add support for `assigned_pod` in `manageTaskMetadata`
- Introduce scoped changelog syncing before task completion
- Enable preview or autosave mode for long-form doc drafting

### üôå Final Word
The framework helped PromptPod deliver precise, rich, and collaborative discovery artifacts. Our Human+AI rhythm was a model for future teams ‚Äî and the AI Career Coach app is well-positioned for build. Let's keep coaching the machine (and each other).
