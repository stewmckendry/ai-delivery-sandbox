## 🧠 Root Cause Analysis: YAML Commit Truncation During Career Knowledgebook Expansion

**Date:** 2025-05-03  
**Task:** `1.5_research_spikes` – Youth Career Knowledgebook for GPT Coach

---

### 🧩 Summary of Issue

While attempting to commit a YAML grounding file with 50+ structured career entries (~7,000+ tokens), the file was repeatedly truncated or overwritten. The full content never appeared in the GitHub repo.

This error was silent — no failure was logged — and only partial YAML content remained.

---

### 🔍 Root Cause

- The `commitAndLogOutput` tool likely hit one or more internal constraints:
  - **API payload size** (~100KB or ~4,000–8,000 tokens)
  - **Token serialization limits** during tool execution
  - **Overwrite behavior** on repeated commits to the same file without append logic

- Because the YAML was committed in a single batch, the content was silently dropped without warning, violating the assumption that the commit was successful.

---

### 💥 Impact

- Loss of 80%+ of the grounding content
- Rework required to repackage and re-segment the YAML
- Product team temporarily blocked from using structured data

---

### ✅ Resolution

- Split grounding content into category-based segments:
  - `segments/youth_career_guide_stem.yaml`, etc.
- Committed each category individually (6+ files total)
- Updated documentation and handoff note to ProductPod with load instructions

---

### 🛠 Recommendations

1. **YAML Commit Limits**
   - Add pre-commit size check (character, line, token count)
   - Introduce `append_yaml()` or YAML merge tool

2. **Error Visibility**
   - Log warnings if truncation or overwrite occurs
   - Validate YAML presence after commit automatically

3. **Process Pattern**
   - For large grounding sets, default to `segments/` directory structure
   - Provide loader/merger logic for devs and GPTs
