## 🧨 Root Cause Analysis: File Overwrites on Task Completion

### 📅 Date: 2025-05-03

### 🧠 Summary
During completion of task `1.6_define_architecture_and_standards`, all previously committed architecture files were unintentionally **overwritten** with a single-line summary due to incorrect usage of the `manageTaskLifecycle.complete` tool.

### ❌ What Happened
- The `outputs` argument in the `complete` call included all output file paths.
- Instead of referencing existing committed files, the `content` field was re-supplied — but only as one-line descriptions.
- This caused the previous, richly developed contents of those files to be overwritten in Git.

### 🧰 Recovery
- Identified correct commit SHA: `e256c9c2ebc5f499faa2cdaa98c16dc50f90a956`
- Performed a manual `git reset --hard` to restore content
- Force-pushed branch to undo the accidental overwrite

### 🧩 Root Cause
- Output `content` in `manageTaskLifecycle.complete` was treated as a new file payload, not metadata.
- Assumed that listing paths would reference existing committed content — it does not.

### 🛠 Suggested Fix
- Avoid including `content` field in `outputs` during `complete` unless generating **new files** inline.
- **Recommendation**: Separate file commits (`commitAndLogOutput`) from task completion entirely.
- Use task completion strictly for logging metadata, not content state.

### ✅ Next Steps
- Log enhancement to clarify task completion behavior and enforce separation of commit vs. complete logic.
- Share rollback instructions for future recoveries.
