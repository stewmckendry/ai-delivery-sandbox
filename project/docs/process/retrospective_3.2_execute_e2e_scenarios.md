## 🔍 Retrospective – Task 3.2_execute_e2e_scenarios

### 🎯 Goal
Run realistic, end-to-end simulations of the Explorer and Mentor flows through CareerCoach-GPT. Validate prompt usage, memory tools, and reflection capture pipelines.

---

### ✅ Wins
- Custom GPT test design enabled full experience simulation
- Users gave creative, realistic responses
- GPT handled flow and narrative synthesis well
- Data consistently landed in Notion and Airtable

---

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- GPTs may omit critical fields (like `career_id`) unless schema enforcement exists
- Schema-driven validation (e.g. OpenAPI requirements) is essential for trustable saves
- Including downstream instructions in test packages helps non-technical users extract value

---

### ⚠️ Pain Points
- Career field was left blank in both saves
- Debugging GPT behavior is indirect and needs better observability

---

### 💡 Recommendations
- Update OpenAPI schema to require all critical fields
- Add GPT-side reminders or structured input capture for required fields
- Include Airtable + Notion review instructions in future tests by default

---

### 🏁 Status
Task successfully completed with real GPT testing, useful feedback surfaced, and process insight captured.
