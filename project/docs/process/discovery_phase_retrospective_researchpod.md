## ðŸ§  Discovery Phase Retrospective â€“ ResearchPod

**Phase:** Discovery  
**Role:** ResearchPod  
**Focus:** Career Knowledgebook + GPT grounding content  
**Period:** Aprilâ€“May 2025

---

### âœ… What We Accomplished

- Created a rich, engaging **career knowledgebook** with over **50 metaphor-driven roles** for youth (ages 9â€“14)
- Mapped roles to skills, values, and learning paths aligned to age-appropriate tone
- Integrated diverse industry sources (NOC, SOC, LinkedIn, WEF) to ensure broad and future-facing coverage
- Converted insights into structured YAML files to power GPT grounding
- Collaborated fluidly with the Human Lead and ProductPod for feedback, tone testing, and segment goals

---

### ðŸ’¡ What Went Well

- **Metaphor-first design** made roles more relatable for youth users
- Human-AI collaboration was **tight and iterative** â€” fast feedback loops led to creative naming, tone tuning
- YAML segmentation turned out to be a robust workaround to file limits and encouraged modular design
- Grounding schema stayed **simple, extensible, and reusable**

---

### ðŸ§± What Could Be Improved

- YAML commit failures were initially **silent and invisible** â€” caused confusion and rework
- We lacked **schema validation or commit checks** for structured data (until retrofitted)
- Single-file commit behavior in `commitAndLogOutput` needs a clearer **append vs overwrite policy**

---

### ðŸ›  Suggestions for Framework Improvements

1. **Pre-commit validation for structured data** (YAML, JSON, Markdown)
2. **Tool feedback for large commits** â€“ warn on content truncation or token overflow
3. **Native support for `segments/` loader utilities** in runtime or RAG GPT prompts
4. Option to **auto-merge YAML segments** during preprocessing

### ðŸ™Œ Thanks & Next Steps

Big thanks to PromptPod and ProductPod for shaping an inspiring foundation. The GPT Coach now has a solid grounding in career discovery.

Ready to move into implementation or testing when the baton passes!
