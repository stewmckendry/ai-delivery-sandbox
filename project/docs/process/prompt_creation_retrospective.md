## 🔍 Retrospective – Prompt Creation Task (prompt_creation-9fd099)

### ✅ What Went Well
- Successfully designed and structured 10 journaling prompts aligned with youth tone and GPT flow.
- Integrated metaphor and creativity for age 9–14 audience, supporting engagement and reflection.
- Prompts follow schema strictly and load successfully via `/load_prompt` endpoint.
- Handoff captured cleanly with scope, assumptions, risks, and next steps.

### 🤔 What Could Be Improved
- Initial commits were mistakenly pushed to `main` instead of the working `sandbox-silent-otter` branch.
- Commit function defaulted to `main`; better habit would be to explicitly confirm and set target branch.

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Always double-check commit targets to avoid cross-branch confusion.
- Structuring prompts as both individual files and a bundle may help flexibility.

### 🛠 Suggestions
- Consider tool enhancement: default commit branch inferred from task context.
- Add a prompt preview tool for faster iteration/testing during UI work.

### 🙌 Thanks
Great inputs and tight alignment on tone, metaphors, and format — made this task smooth and creative to execute.
