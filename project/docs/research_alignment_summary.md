# Alignment with Deep Research Recommendations

This document tracks how the system aligns with findings from:
- ✅ *AI-Assisted Access to Healthcare Portals* (Security, Consent, Compliance)
- ✅ *AI-Powered Web Scraping Pipeline* (Traversal, Extraction, Structuring)

---

## 🔐 AI Portal Access Security
| Recommendation | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Secure credential vault + TTL | ✅ Implemented with Redis + Fernet (Task 19) |
| Explicit user consent + audit log | ✅ Done (Task 21 + `audit.py`) |
| Human-in-the-loop MFA/CAPTCHA | ✅ Integrated in Task 22 challenge flow |
| Session isolation per user | ✅ Each browser session is ephemeral (Playwright) |
| Audit trail for AI actions | ✅ Logged via `log_event()` and session hooks |
| Token-based delegation | 🟡 Prototype only (Task 23) — backlog for session reuse or SSO |
| Secure credential input (no LLM exposure) | ✅ Enforced via secure backend-only fields |
| Session cleanup post-scrape | ✅ Auto logout + browser close in orchestrator |
| Transparency (logs to user) | 🟡 Logs exist; user dashboard not yet implemented |
| Compliance (HIPAA, GDPR) | ✅ Design aligned: consent, audit, no PHI in LLM |

---

## 🌐 AI-Native Web Scraping Pipeline
| Recommendation | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dynamic traversal of link graph | 🟡 Task 24 in progress — scoring + depth rules |
| Content extraction with LLM | 🟡 Task 25 in progress — tag `lab_result`, `note`, etc. |
| Chunking + deduplication | 🟡 Task 26 in progress — sliding window, overlap merge |
| Document download + metadata | ✅ Already handled in orchestrator via `save_file()` |
| Semantic tagging (e.g. FHIR types) | 🟡 Partial — schema exists; FHIR mapping TBD |
| Summarization (recursive) | ✅ Supported via `summarizer.py` with recursive strategy |
| RAG-ready structuring | ✅ JSON with metadata used across outputs |
| Use of LangChain/Unstructured tools | 🟡 Planned integration after core flow is solid |
| LLM for classification & structuring | ✅ Integrated into Task 25 prompt template design |
| FHIR compliance / ICD code lookup | ⏳ Backlog — can post-process with terminology APIs |

---

## 📌 Planned (Not Yet Started)
- User-visible consent + activity log dashboard
- Token reuse for session resume / SSO
- Full FHIR resource mapping + terminology integration
- Headless flow using LangChain + Unstructured toolkit for speed

---

## ✅ Summary
We have implemented all core security, consent, and credential lifecycle features. Generalized scraping is underway via Tasks 24–26. Advanced features like delegation tokens and structured coding (FHIR, LOINC, ICD) are in the backlog, to be scoped once the baseline system stabilizes.
