# 🧭 Operator in Phase 3: Notes from Real-World Testing

## ✅ Successful Portal Sessions
The AI Health Records Copilot successfully used OpenAI Operator to retrieve data from three real-world health systems:

| Portal Type | Name                             | Outcome |
|-------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| Fitness     | Strava                           | ✅ Success: HTML export used |
| Lab         | LifeLabs                         | ✅ Success: PDF and HTML captured |
| Hospital    | Unity Health Toronto MyChart     | ✅ Success: Visit summaries captured |

In each session:
- The user (Stewart) retained full control and gave **explicit instructions and consent**
- **Login credentials were never stored**
- Operator clearly displayed actions and enabled manual override at any time

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Control Model
Operator was used within a privacy-respecting, user-in-the-loop workflow:
- Users initiated Operator with purpose-specific prompts
- Authentication was manual — Operator never had raw credentials
- File saves were user-approved and exported via browser mechanisms (Save as HTML, or site PDF button)
- Sessions were time-bound and data was transferred only after user confirmation

This approach aligns with a safe-by-default design for handling personal health data.

## ⚠️ Preview Limitations
While the tool worked effectively, Operator remains in **technical preview** and presented some challenges:

- ❌ Some sites blocked or challenged Operator via Cloudflare or CAPTCHAs
- ❌ Limited browser features: print, scripting, and external API access are disabled
- ❌ Isolated from ChatGPT: users must manually return to continue workflow
- ⚠️ Occasional bugs — e.g., Operator failed to re-engage after user input in rare cases

---

## 🔮 Outlook & Future Potential
Despite limitations, Operator is already proving valuable for:
- Enabling data retrieval from systems with no APIs or exports
- Allowing patients to collect their health records securely, on-demand

Looking ahead:
- ✅ More robust automation and scheduling (e.g., "check for new lab results every week")
- ✅ Tighter integration with GPT (seamless chat-to-Operator round-trips)
- ✅ More export and interop capabilities (PDF printing, annotations, batch tools)

As bugs are fixed and capabilities expand, Operator will become an increasingly essential tool in patient-centered data ecosystems.

## 📌 Summary
OpenAI Operator is now proven to work across key health record portals when guided by a patient-facing Copilot. While still early, its design enables safe, transparent, and effective access to personal health data — even in legacy systems.

This phase confirms its role as a critical bridge in AI-native health data collection.
