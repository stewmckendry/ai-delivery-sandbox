### 🎯 What’s Delivered

**Markdown Summary:** High-level overview and themes

**YAML Grounding Files:** Split by category to avoid commit limits. Each file contains structured entries with:
- Title + playful metaphor (e.g., “Data Scientist – The Pattern Detective”)
- Skills, traits, values
- Optional quotes, inspiration, and learning path

**Segmented YAMLs:**
- `segments/youth_career_guide_stem.yaml`

- `segments/youth_career_guide_animal.yaml`
- `segments/youth_career_guide_earth.yaml`

### 🧠 Why It Matters
- Designed for ages 9–14: safe, imaginative, encouraging
- Covers both today’s common jobs and tomorrow’s emerging roles
- Each entry helps GPT offer grounded, diverse suggestions

---

### 🛠 How to Use It
- Load one or more YAML files dynamically (e.g. `load_yaml_segment("stem")`)
- Combine files if desired using a YAML merge utility
- GPT prompting can use:
  - Category selector
  - Random career explorer
  - Metaphor-inspired encouragement

---

### 📁 Notes
