# üìò Operator Usage Guidance

These notes explain how to use OpenAI Operator with the provided prompt templates to gather health records.

## üó∫Ô∏è Steps
1. In Copilot, select the appropriate prompt from `project/prompts/operator_templates.md` and open OpenAI Operator.
2. Log in to your portal manually when the browser appears.
3. Paste the prompt into Operator and confirm each step.
4. Prefer **PDF** downloads. Use HTML only if a PDF option is unavailable.
5. Save files using the convention `portal_DATE_type.pdf` (for example `mychart_2024-05-01_visit.pdf`).
6. After downloading, close the Operator tab or return to the Copilot chat to upload your file.

### Troubleshooting
- If you hit reCAPTCHA or Cloudflare blocks, save the page as HTML or print to PDF and upload it from `/upload`.
- Some portals disable direct downloads; use your browser's Save Page As or Print dialog instead.

## üîÑ Returning to Copilot
- Operator will remind you to return once the file is saved.
- Upload the file via the secure link provided in chat.
- Repeat the process for additional documents as needed.

Use these guidelines with the prompt templates to collect visit summaries, lab reports, billing statements, or an entire record export.
