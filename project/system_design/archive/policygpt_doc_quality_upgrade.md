# Enhancing PolicyGPT Document Quality: Aligning with Deep Research

## (1) How ChatGPT “Deep Research” Produces High-Quality Reports

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Recursive Query Decomposition** | Breaks down user requests into sub-questions, automatically executes background lookups, and composes integrated responses. |
| **Tool Invocation** | Deep Research has privileged access to internal tools (search, code interpreter, document reader), called autonomously during generation. |
| **Chain-of-Thought Planning** | Structures output using an internal reasoning scaffold: it plans before writing, integrating multiple perspectives or evidence threads. |
| **Memory Buffering** | Maintains a deeper contextual state across a longer exchange to enable section-by-section construction of documents with consistency. |
| **Auto-Sourcing and Citation** | Identifies key facts, verifies through reference sources, and annotates with inline citations or footnotes. |
| **Style-Consistent Templates** | Generates content aligned with academic, legal, technical, or policy genres by applying document-type-specific learned styles. |
| **Multi-Pass Refinement** | Iterates internally or through follow-up steps to refine draft structure, add missing elements, or clean language. |

## (2) Comparison: Deep Research vs. PolicyGPT System Design

### ✅ Areas Well-Aligned with Deep Research

| Design Area | Alignment Strength |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Prompt scaffolding per section | Matches Deep Research's planning-based prompting. |
| YAML-driven structure enforcement | Equivalent to structured memory and templates. |
| Evidence tools like `search_knowledge_base` | Parallel to autonomous background lookups. |
| Metadata validation at commit | Good for auditability and credibility. |
| Use of Drive + editable overflow links | Mirrors fallback mechanisms in Deep Research. |
| Session memory model and draft versioning | Enables traceable, progressive drafting. |
| Chunking + reassembly | Supports multi-pass generation like Deep Research. |

### ⚠️ Areas Not Fully Aligned

| Weak Point | Why It’s Not Enough |
|------------|---------------------|
| Limited autonomous reasoning | Tools are manually invoked, not agent-driven. |
| No embedded planning before generation | Lacks outline-first drafting method. |
| No tool chaining | Tools not sequenced or reused autonomously. |
| Evidence integration is manual | No auto-citation or fact weaving. |
| No structured reasoning trace | Metadata but no “how we got here” logs. |

### ❓ Missing Capabilities

| Missing Capability | Why It Matters |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Agent-style orchestration | Needed for end-to-end generation quality. |
| Semantic validation of output | Ensures outputs match requirements. |
| Cohesion across sections | Enables cross-section consistency. |
| Inline evidence rendering | Increases trust and traceability. |

## (3) Recommendations to Match Deep Research Output Quality

### 1. Add an Agentic Planner Layer
Create a planning agent that:
- Reads section requirements
- Builds an outline
- Plans tool calls (e.g., search > draft > revise)

### 2. Enable Autonomous Tool Chaining
Allow GPT to:
- Search
- Summarize
- Draft — all in one tool sequence

### 3. Introduce Section Quality Validators
Build a post-generation validator that checks:
- Required YAML fields
- Semantic alignment with goals

### 4. Add Reasoning Trace Logging
Log:
- Prompt
- Tools used
- Evidence selected
- Reasoning steps

### 5. Use Inline Evidence Rendering
Update tools to include `[source]` or footnotes inline with content.

### 6. Build a Full-Report Orchestrator
Create a “compose full report” flow to ensure:
- Section-by-section cohesion
- Narrative consistency
