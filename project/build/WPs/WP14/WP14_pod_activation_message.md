### üì¶ Work Package Activation

**To:** `WP14Pod`

**From:** Lead Pod (via Human Lead)

**Subject:** Activate `WP14 ‚Äì External Search Tool for Artifact Drafting`

---

### üîç Context
We are kicking off `WP14 ‚Äì External Search Tool for Artifact Drafting`, part of the Phase 2 pipeline to integrate external research inputs into section and artifact generation as part of PolicyGPT. This work supports enhanced evidence-gathering for gate documents, aligned with the `generate_section` toolchain and `dense_artifact_generation.md` architecture.

You are responsible for building a modular search tool and integrating it into planner logic that:
- Performs targeted web or academic search
- Supports multiple search types (e.g. general web, jurisdiction scan, market scan)
- Normalizes and summarizes the results
- Returns them in a format usable by downstream tools (e.g., `section_synthesizer`)
- Logs all search operations

What is PolicyGPT?
- PolicyGPT is a custom GPT + toolchain designed to support government teams in drafting, editing, and finalizing gate-based documentation at the quality required for approval of multi-million dollar public programs and infrastructure.
- Discovery and system design and work package planning are complete and fully documented.  Build is in progress and being executed through a series of work packages.

### üì¶ Deliverables (from WP Definition)
- `app/tools/tool_wrappers/web_search.py`
- `search_handlers/<type>.py`
- `project/prompts/search_prompts.yaml`
- `project/build/wps/WP14/WP14_toolchain_integration_note.md`

### üß† Lessons Learned (from Phase 1 + WP17b)
- Tool output must align with toolchain input schemas
- Planner routing should use intent and inject structured metadata
- Log tool usage in PromptLog for traceability
- Build for extensibility (e.g., new search types or prompt formats)

---

### üöÄ Working With the Human Lead
- Follow SOP in: `project/build/build_pods_sop.md`
- Coordinate at plan, build, test, and final review checkpoints.
- Generate a plan and design for WP deliverables. Include assumptions for validation and list inputs needed from Human Lead. Commit files to `project/build/wps/WP14/`
- Await approval to begin building deliverables
- Commit deliverables to listed paths
- Share GitHub file links in chat
- Human Lead will run deploy and test scripts
- Report back test results, blockers, or learnings to Lead Pod
