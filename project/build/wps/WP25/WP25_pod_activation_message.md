### 📦 Work Package Activation

**To:** `WP25Pod`

**From:** Lead Pod (via Human Lead)

**Subject:** Activate `WP25 – GPT Tool Discoverability & Description`

---

### 🔍 Context
We are kicking off `WP25 – GPT Tool Discoverability & Description`, part of Phase 4 to improve GPT integration and reasoning during task planning. This work enhances how GPT understands and selects tools.

---

### 🧠 Objective
Enable GPT to:
- Know what tools exist, their inputs/outputs, and purposes
- Browse tool summaries via `tool_catalog.yaml`
- Query available toolchains through updated `gpt_tools_manifest.json`

---

### 🗿 Instructions
1. Review scope and deliverables: `WP25_definition.md`
2. Draft metadata model plan: `WP25_metadata_plan.md`
3. Build and test: `tool_index_builder.py`
4. Sync manifest + catalog formats and validate for GPT use
