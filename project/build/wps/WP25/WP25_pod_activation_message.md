### 📦 Work Package Activation

**To:** `WP25Pod`

**From:** Lead Pod (via Human Lead)

**Subject:** Activate `WP25 – GPT Tool Discoverability & Description`

---

### 🔍 Context
We are kicking off `WP25 – GPT Tool Discoverability & Description`, part of Phase 4 to improve GPT integration and reasoning during task planning. This work enhances how GPT understands and selects tools.

---

### 🧠 Objective
Enable GPT to:
- Know what tools exist, their inputs/outputs, and purposes
- Browse tool summaries via `tool_catalog.yaml`
- Query available toolchains through updated `gpt_tools_manifest.json`

---

### 🗿 Instructions
1. Review your WP scope and deliverables (system/fetchFile: `project/build/wps/WP25/WP25_definition.md`)
2. Fetch reference files (see below)
3. Draft design plan and task list. Commit to: `project/build/wps/WP25/`
4. Build and test deliverables
5. Request Human Lead review and provide midpoint + final updates to Pod Lead
