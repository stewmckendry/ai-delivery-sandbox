## WP9 Update Summary

### âœ… Completed
- Implemented ingestion tools for uploading text, files, and links
- Inputs are stored as YAML traces and database logs
- CLI and API support complete for 4 tools:
  - `uploadTextInput`
  - `uploadFileInput`
  - `uploadLinkInput`
  - `createSessionSnapshot`
- PromptLog and SessionSnapshot database models added
- Database read/write handlers implemented
- Test inputs processed via CLI and backend

### âž• Appended Summary (May 21)
We have now implemented the ability to upload user inputs as text, file, or URL via **CLI or backend API** calls. These inputs are logged locally as YAML files (`logs/ingest_traces/`) and can be programmatically stored into a structured database (`PromptLog`, `SessionSnapshot`).

#### Remaining Work (Lead Pod to Prioritize):
- Connect to front-end UI for custom GPT input interface
- Integrate ingestion logs with Planner toolchains
- Utilize `PromptLog` and `SessionSnapshot` records for doc generation
- Store raw input files to Google Drive and link paths in the DB

We created 4 new tools: `uploadTextInput`, `uploadFileInput`, `uploadLinkInput`, and `createSessionSnapshot`. An addendum has been added to the tool catalog documentation:
- ðŸ“„ `project/build/wps/WP9/tool_catalog_addendum.md`

We also implemented a database-backed logging system with schema documentation here:
- ðŸ“„ `project/build/wps/WP9/db_schema_overview.md`

WP12 Pod should update `tool_catalog_v2.md` and system architecture docs to reflect these additions.
