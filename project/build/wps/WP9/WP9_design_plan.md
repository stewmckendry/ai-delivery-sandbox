### 🔄 Integration with WP16 + PolicyGPT User Flow

#### 🧭 Dual Input Modes (from WP16)
- **Guided Prompt Mode**: Users respond to dynamic prompts generated by `input_prompt_generator.py`. Inputs flow into WP9’s `uploadTextInput` tool for ingestion.
- **Data Dump Mode**: Users upload multiple files/links or paste unstructured text. Each is processed through WP9’s ingestion tools (`uploadFileInput`, `uploadLinkInput`).

#### 🔄 Shared Processing Layer
- Regardless of entry path, all inputs flow through:
  - Sanitization/parsing (`text_extractor.py`)
  - Structure/tagging (`structured_input_ingestor.py`)
  - Memory logging (`memory_sync.py`)

---

### 📁 Multi-Input Support
- **YES**: WP9 supports ingesting multiple files/text blocks at once.
- Processed in batch under-the-hood, each routed through tool wrappers.
- Minimizes user friction in “data dump” scenarios.

### 🧠 Memory and Storage Targets
| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| `PromptLog` | Stores sanitized content and metadata from each input |
| `SessionSnapshot` | Captures aggregate view post-ingestion |
| `ingest_trace.yaml` | Trace log per input — debuggable and replayable |
| `project_profile.yaml` | Optionally stores source mappings |
| External Storage | Not in WP9 scope — future file persistence to Drive/blob |

---

### 🧾 Role in Content Generation
- Ingested inputs are mid-term memory for planner prompts.
- Used in filling structured templates, grounding GPT responses.
- Toolchain can cite origin content or trace to sections.
- Enables WP16’s completeness checker and WP1a’s section composer.

### 🎯 Summary
WP9 is a foundation for memory-grounded, traceable inputs. It supports both user-facing flows and backend orchestration across planner and generation WPs.
