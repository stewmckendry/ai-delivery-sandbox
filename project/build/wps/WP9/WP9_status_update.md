## WP9 Status Update (May 21, 2025)

### ðŸŽ¯ Summary
WP9 is now complete. We delivered a full ingestion pipeline for user inputs (text, files, links), plus session memory and DB logging. These tools now support planner toolchains and ensure inputs are processed into YAML summaries with metadata.

### âœ… Completed Deliverables
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/tools/structured_input_ingestor.py` | Parses and labels user inputs |
| `app/tools/retry_ingestion.py` | Adds retry/backoff logic on ingestion failure |
| `app/tools/text_extractor.py` | Extracts content from file uploads |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/uploadTextInput.py` | Handles freeform user input |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/uploadFileInput.py` | Handles file-based uploads |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/uploadLinkInput.py` | Handles URL inputs |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/createSessionSnapshot.py` | Captures session snapshots for context |
| `app/db/models/PromptLog.py` | Logs tool inputs/outputs |
| `app/db/models/SessionSnapshot.py` | Stores snapshot metadata |
| `app/engines/memory_sync.py` | Database write handler for ingestions |

### ðŸ“¦ Added
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/cli_ingest_runner.py` | CLI-based entry point for tool ingestion |
| `project/build/wps/WP9/WP9_status_update.md` | Summary of status and file paths |

### ðŸ“„ Deferred
| Deliverable | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| `WP9_input_summary_flow.md` | Added to close WP â€” currently generating |
| ErrorLog handling | Out of scope â€” owned by WP3c |

### Next Steps
- Confirm downstream usage in WP3a is functioning with new tools.
- Ensure WP16 handles guided prompts for missing input.

## Addenndum to WP9 Update Summary

### âœ… Completed
- Implemented ingestion tools for uploading text, files, and links
- Inputs are stored as YAML traces and database logs
- CLI and API support complete for 4 tools:
  - `uploadTextInput`
  - `uploadFileInput`
  - `uploadLinkInput`
  - `createSessionSnapshot`
- PromptLog and SessionSnapshot database models added
- Database read/write handlers implemented
- Test inputs processed via CLI and backend

### âž• Appended Summary (May 21)
We have now implemented the ability to upload user inputs as text, file, or URL via **CLI or backend API** calls. These inputs are logged locally as YAML files (`logs/ingest_traces/`) and can be programmatically stored into a structured database (`PromptLog`, `SessionSnapshot`).

#### Remaining Work (Lead Pod to Prioritize):
- Connect to front-end UI for custom GPT input interface
- Integrate ingestion logs with Planner toolchains
- Utilize `PromptLog` and `SessionSnapshot` records for doc generation
- Store raw input files to Google Drive and link paths in the DB

We created 4 new tools: `uploadTextInput`, `uploadFileInput`, `uploadLinkInput`, and `createSessionSnapshot`. An addendum has been added to the tool catalog documentation:
- ðŸ“„ `project/build/wps/WP9/tool_catalog_addendum.md`

We also implemented a database-backed logging system with schema documentation here:
- ðŸ“„ `project/build/wps/WP9/db_schema_overview.md`

WP12 Pod should update `tool_catalog_v2.md` and system architecture docs to reflect these additions.

Thanks all â€” tools are now live for ingesting inputs across modalities.
