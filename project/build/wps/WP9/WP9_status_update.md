## WP9 Status Update (May 21, 2025)

### ðŸŽ¯ Summary
WP9 is now complete. We delivered a full ingestion pipeline for user inputs (text, files, links), plus session memory and DB logging. These tools now support planner toolchains and ensure inputs are processed into YAML summaries with metadata.

### âœ… Completed Deliverables
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/tools/structured_input_ingestor.py` | Parses and labels user inputs |
| `app/tools/retry_ingestion.py` | Adds retry/backoff logic on ingestion failure |
| `app/tools/text_extractor.py` | Extracts content from file uploads |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/uploadTextInput.py` | Handles freeform user input |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/uploadFileInput.py` | Handles file-based uploads |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/uploadLinkInput.py` | Handles URL inputs |
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/createSessionSnapshot.py` | Captures session snapshots for context |
| `app/db/models/PromptLog.py` | Logs tool inputs/outputs |
| `app/db/models/SessionSnapshot.py` | Stores snapshot metadata |
| `app/engines/memory_sync.py` | Database write handler for ingestions |

### ðŸ“¦ Added
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/tools/tool_wrappers/cli_ingest_runner.py` | CLI-based entry point for tool ingestion |
| `project/build/wps/WP9/WP9_status_update.md` | Summary of status and file paths |

### ðŸ“„ Deferred
| Deliverable | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| `WP9_input_summary_flow.md` | Added to close WP â€” currently generating |
| ErrorLog handling | Out of scope â€” owned by WP3c |

### Next Steps
- Confirm downstream usage in WP3a is functioning with new tools.
- Ensure WP16 handles guided prompts for missing input.

Thanks all â€” tools are now live for ingesting inputs across modalities.
