## ðŸ“„ Schema Export Pending
Due to current environment constraints, the full OpenAPI YAML/JSON export is not included here but can be generated by running:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Then visiting:
- `http://localhost:8000/docs` for Swagger UI
- `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` for raw schema

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- All tools in `tool_catalog.yaml` are reachable at `/tools/{tool_id}`
- The schema will dynamically expand as tools grow their input/output types
- Schema validation and examples should be added once tool implementations are finalized
