### 🛰️ WP1a Midpoint Update – Scaffolding + Assembly

**Pod:** WP1aPod  
**Work Package:** WP1a – Scaffolding + Assembly  
**Status:** ✅ Midpoint Milestone Achieved

---

### ✅ Accomplishments

We have successfully implemented and validated the WP1a document generation pipeline:

1. **Gate Section Scaffolder** – Creates structured empty sections for any gate+artifact from `gate_reference_v2.yaml`
2. **Gate Section Expander** – Adds placeholder content for each section using a memory session ID
3. **Final Document Assembler** – Combines sections into Markdown and JSON (`gateblock`) outputs with embedded metadata
4. **Deployment/Test Pipeline** – Fully CLI-operable and verified through local test run by Human Lead

---

### 🔬 Observations

- The gate scaffolder originally assumed `gate_id` and `artifact_id` were string keys; we patched it to match the actual schema (`gate_id` as int, `artifacts` as list).
- Section metadata extraction was updated to reflect the field `section_id` (not `id`).
- All tools now accept CLI args and support JSON/Markdown export where needed.

---

### 🧱 Design Intent

This WP is intentionally scoped as a **stub/skeleton** to:
- Demonstrate the full scaffold → expand → assemble pipeline
- Validate that we can flow `gate_reference` → scaffold → memory-aware content → output docs

It does **not** include full memory integration, tool-assisted expansion, or dynamic routing logic — these are expected in future pods.

---

### 📈 Next Enhancements

Recommended areas for WP2/WP3:

1. **Memory Integration**  
   Inject dynamic content per section from session memory store

2. **Toolchain Expansion**  
   Use `tool_catalog_v2.md` functions (e.g. cost tables, risk modelers) during section expansion

3. **GPT-Driven Assembly**  
   Enable LLM to generate gateblock content directly from policies, rules, and prior inputs

4. **Output Formatting + QA**  
   Add automated validation and style rules (from `gating_doc_quality_v2.md`)

---

### 💡 Suggestions for Next Pods

- **Start with a working CLI pipeline.** It builds confidence and minimizes early UI dependency.
- **Verify schema alignment early.** We lost some time due to mismatch in field names.
- **Use Git-hosted reference data** where possible for consistency.
- **Keep sections modular** and composable — current pipeline is reusable for any artifact.
