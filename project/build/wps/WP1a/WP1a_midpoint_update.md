## WP1a Midpoint Status Update – Scaffolding + Assembly

**Status:** ✅ On Track  
**Pod:** `WP1aPod`  
**Task ID:** `2.2_build_and_patch`

---

### ✅ Progress Summary
We have completed core implementation for:
- `gate_section_scaffolder.py` – parses gate_reference_v2.yaml (now fetched from GitHub URL)
- `gate_section_expander.py` – expands scaffold sections via stubbed GPT + session ID
- `final_document_assembler.py` – outputs `.md` + `.json` gateblock document artifacts

All tools are implemented and committed.

---

### 🧪 What This Demonstrates
This work package demonstrates a working **stubbed pipeline** that:
- Reads a gate + artifact definition from `gate_reference_v2.yaml`
- Generates placeholder scaffolds section-by-section
- Simulates memory-aware expansion via GPT stub
- Assembles outputs into production-style `.md` and `.json` files

This confirms the technical feasibility and structure for:
- Section-by-section gate document generation
- Pipeline modularity for future tool integration

---

### ⚠️ Known Gaps / Follow-On
This WP intentionally used mocked/stub logic to demonstrate pipeline structure.
Replacing these stubs with full GPT prompting, memory integration, and citations will be handled in:
- **WP2 – Policy Assembly Engine** (as defined in WP2_definition.md)

Also noted:
- Current reference YAML is fetched from a GitHub raw URL – this may be revised based on deployment environment

---

### ⏭️ Next
Proceeding to:
- Write deployment + test documentation
- Implement unit/integration test coverage
- Validate outputs against gate quality criteria
