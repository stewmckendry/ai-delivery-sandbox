## 🔄 WP20 Retrospective – Drive Integration

### What Went Well ✅
- Clear scope and upstream alignment from WP18/WP3b
- Smooth integration with existing toolchain (`assemble_artifact_chain.py`)
- PDF output gave clean, polished artifact view
- OAuth/service account setup worked with env-based auth separation
- Drive folder structure provided clarity and version traceability
- Strong test coverage with CLI and end-to-end flows

### What Was Tricky ⚠️
- `file_path` needed patch in `DocumentVersionLog`
- WeasyPrint TOC anchors caused PDF warnings
- Drive permissions/preview required exact service account config
- Needed consistent logging + fallbacks for failure traceability

### Key Decisions 📌
- **PDF over Markdown** for viewability and external sharing
- **Pydantic tool wrappers** for validation consistency
- **Versioned filenames** to avoid overwrite edge cases
- **Drive structure** based on `gate_id/artifact_id` (with `project_id` noted as spillover)

### Improvements for Future WPs 🧠
- Introduce toolchain schema validation at config level
- Ensure DB schema updates are tracked alongside tool changes
- Run drive upload test earlier in integration loop
- Add support for project_id + broader folder configs
- Auto-link drive upload in UI / feedback summaries

### Overall ✅
This WP added foundational functionality to make PolicyGPT document commits durable, shareable, and externally accessible via Google Drive. It unblocked multiple downstream scenarios, added architectural reuse, and created a pattern for future integrations.
