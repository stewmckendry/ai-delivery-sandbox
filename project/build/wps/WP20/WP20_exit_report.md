## 🚪 WP20 Exit Report – Drive Integration

### 📌 Objective
Build tools to store and retrieve final gate artifacts from Google Drive, enabling structured cross-org sharing, version control, and persistent access.

---

### ✅ What Was Built
- **storeToDrive.py** – Uploads finalized PDF to Google Drive
- **fetchFromDrive.py** – Locates and returns Drive-stored PDFs
- PDF rendering from markdown via `weasyprint`
- Toolchain patch: integrated `storeToDrive` into `assemble_artifact_chain.py`
- DB patch: added `google_doc_url` (and `file_path`) to `DocumentVersionLog`
- Full test suite, test data, and result logs committed
- Auth config using `.env` + Railway env vars

---

### 🌍 Impact & Value
- **User-friendly access** to final gate docs
- **Persistent links** for sharing and review
- **Cross-org editing loop** now supported (with fetch tool)
- **Enables future workflows** like GPT-driven diffing, analysis, and traceability

---

### 🔍 Tool Deep Dive

#### 🗃️ storeToDrive.py
- Triggered by Planner toolchain on commit
- Converts markdown → styled PDF
- Stores in `PolicyGPT/gate_<gate_id>/<artifact_id>/`
- Saves link to DB

Used by: GPT + Planner orchestrator at commit time

#### 🔎 fetchFromDrive.py
- Triggered by user or GPTs
- Locates PDF by gate_id, artifact_id, version
- Returns filename + link

Used by: Review tools, diff tools, UI viewers

---

### 📤 Spillovers / Future Work
- Support DOCX upload or output
- Add `project_id` to folder routing schema
- Support preview/stream fetch instead of PDF
- Enable permission-based sharing (external reviewers)
- Auto-diff support between Drive version and draft
- Integrate into UI frontend

---

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- OAuth setup must be tested early (and logged)
- Drive folder routing must enforce uniqueness (gate/artifact/version)
- PDF gives better formatting and portability than raw markdown
- Logging and URL traceability are essential for debugging + user support

---

### 📈 Status
- ✅ Design complete
- ✅ Tools built + tested
- ✅ Integrated into toolchain
- ✅ Deployed and functional

PolicyGPT can now upload and retrieve versioned gate artifacts to Drive — enabling full-cycle document governance.
