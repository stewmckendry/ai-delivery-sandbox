## WP ID: WP7
## WP Name: Project Profile Engine

### üåü Outcome
By the end of this WP, as a **policy drafter or approver**, I will be able to define, update, and retrieve the active project profile that informs how PolicyGPT operates. This profile will evolve dynamically with user inputs and system outputs to ensure tailored document generation.

### üßΩ Scope
**In Scope:**
- Creating and persisting a `ProjectProfile` model
- Initializing `project_profile.yaml` as a template for project settings
- Dynamically updating the `project_profile` in memory during sessions
- Using profile fields to guide generation and validation logic
- Exposing the profile to users via a `showProfile` tool
- Automatically updating profile as part of the background tool chaining process
- **Drive folder routing enhancement**: Embed `project_id` from ProjectProfile into Drive pathing logic to support structured output organization (e.g., `/Drive/Projects/<project_id>/`)
- **Toolchain context injection**: Ensure `project_id`, `project_type`, and other profile fields are passed to downstream tools for contextual drafting, validation, and logging


**Out of Scope:**
- User-facing UI to edit the profile (covered in future UI WPs)
- Full lifecycle audit of changes (handled in logging WPs)

### üî® Task Breakdown for WP7

1. **Schema Design**
   - Define SQLAlchemy `ProjectProfile` model with required fields
   - Create YAML template with default structure and placeholder values

2. **Tool Creation**
   - Build `show_profile.py` CLI/REST tool to expose live profile
   - Implement `project_profile_updater.py` to ingest session/tool output and update profile in memory and DB

3. **Planner + Tool Integration**
   - Hook profile context injection into planner task orchestration
   - Validate tool wrappers can consume injected profile fields

4. **Drive Folder Mapping**
   - Define folder schema using `project_id` as root path component
   - Create mapping logic or helper utility

5. **Validation + Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all profile tools
   - Simulate live session with updates to ensure planner + tool updates are reflected
   - Test Drive routing with different profiles

6. **Documentation**
   - Document all tools and config formats
   - Update dev onboarding guide to include profile update examples

7. **Deploy + Monitor**
   - Include deploy steps for DB + default YAML
   - Add logs for update events with profile trace output


### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `ProjectProfile` object is initialized and persisted for each project
- [ ] YAML reference can be loaded and edited
- [ ] Updates to the profile occur automatically in memory during session execution
- [ ] The profile influences scaffolding, drafting, and validation
- [ ] Users can run `showProfile` to inspect project configuration
- [ ] Drive folder paths dynamically reflect the `project_id`
- [ ] Tools receive and log `project_id` as part of input context
- [ ] Planner injects project context from `ProjectProfile` into every tool in the chain


### üí™ Tasks

| T3 | Build `project_profile_updater.py` for runtime updates |
| T4 | Implement `show_profile.py` tool for user access |
| T5 | Add hooks in planner to update profile during tool chaining |
| T6 | Validate profile values are being consumed by key tools |

### üìù Notes to Development Team
- Profile values will influence gate detection, document generation, and quality checks.
- Treat the profile as an evolving state: not static YAML, but a live config context.
- Must persist between sessions and reload on reconnect.

### üß† Clarifications
- üß† The profile is updated as part of the **toolchain planner execution** ‚Äì tools can write metadata back to the profile.
- üîÑ While the YAML file seeds the profile, live updates occur in memory and in the DB.
- üëÅ Users can inspect it at any time via the `showProfile` tool.
