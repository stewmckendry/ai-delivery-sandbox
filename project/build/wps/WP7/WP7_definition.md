## WP ID: WP7
## WP Name: Project Profile Engine

### üåü Outcome
By the end of this WP, as a **policy drafter or approver**, I will be able to define, update, and retrieve the active project profile that informs how PolicyGPT operates. This profile will evolve dynamically with user inputs and system outputs to ensure tailored document generation.

### üßΩ Scope
**In Scope:**
- Creating and persisting a `ProjectProfile` model
- Initializing `project_profile.yaml` as a template for project settings
- Dynamically updating the `project_profile` in memory during sessions
- Using profile fields to guide generation and validation logic
- Exposing the profile to users via a `showProfile` tool
- Automatically updating profile as part of the background tool chaining process
- **Drive folder routing enhancement**: Embed `project_id` from ProjectProfile into Drive pathing logic to support structured output organization (e.g., `/Drive/Projects/<project_id>/`)
- **Toolchain context injection**: Ensure `project_id`, `project_type`, and other profile fields are passed to downstream tools for contextual drafting, validation, and logging
- Provide `project_id`, `project_type`, and other fields to `generate_section` and related toolchains via planner injection.
- Ensure `ArtifactSection` saves and references the `project_id` for multi-project environments.
- Extend `ReasoningTrace` logging to include active `project_profile` snapshot or hash.
- Support project profile scaffolding from early PromptLog inputs (e.g., project name or sector captured during user setup).
- Ensure `project_id` is captured and passed to `assemble_artifact` and other toolchains, and logged in `DocumentVersionLog` and Drive outputs (WP18/WP20 compatibility).
- Validate that multiple active projects can coexist and be correctly switched within a session.
- Dynamically extract `project_id`, `project_type`, or sector metadata from early WP9 tool logs (e.g. `uploadTextInput`, `uploadFileInput`) and use it to seed or update the `ProjectProfile`.
- Include fallback logic to initialize minimal profile from any WP9 ingestion input that does not contain `project_id` explicitly but may imply it through sector or title keywords.


**Out of Scope:**
- User-facing UI to edit the profile (covered in future UI WPs)
- Full lifecycle audit of changes (handled in logging WPs)

### üî® Task Breakdown for WP7

1. **Schema Design**
   - Define SQLAlchemy `ProjectProfile` model with required fields
   - Create YAML template with default structure and placeholder values

2. **Tool Creation**
   - Build `show_profile.py` CLI/REST tool to expose live profile
   - Implement `project_profile_updater.py` to ingest session/tool output and update profile in memory and DB

3. **Planner + Tool Integration**
   - Hook profile context injection into planner task orchestration
   - Validate tool wrappers can consume injected profile fields

4. **Drive Folder Mapping**
   - Define folder schema using `project_id` as root path component
   - Create mapping logic or helper utility

5. **üì¶ Toolchain Wiring (with WP9 Tools)**
    - **Enhance Toolchain Context Injection:**
        - Automatically attach active `project_profile` fields to every tool call in the WP9 ingestion chain (including `uploadTextInput`, `uploadLinkInput`, etc).
        - Update WP7 task T5 to explicitly include wiring for `upload*` tools in addition to planner-executed tasks.

### üìù Notes to Development Team
- Profile values will influence gate detection, document generation, and quality checks.
- Treat the profile as an evolving state: not static YAML, but a live config context.
- Must persist between sessions and reload on reconnect.
- The `project_id` must be included in all downstream logs, documents, and filenames to ensure traceability and enable Drive routing.
- All toolchains (e.g., `assemble_artifact`) must receive the correct project context via planner injection.
- Test session restoration with multiple profiles to ensure profile state isolation.

### üß† Clarifications 
- üß† The profile is updated as part of the **toolchain planner execution** ‚Äì tools can write metadata back to the profile. Ensure the planner supports:
    - Injecting the current `project_profile` into each tool‚Äôs `input_dict`
    - Logging active `project_id` and metadata into each tool‚Äôs PromptLog and ReasoningTrace step
    - Switching profiles on session resume or user change
- üîÑ While the YAML file seeds the profile, live updates occur in memory and in the DB.
- üëÅ Users can inspect it at any time via the `showProfile` tool.
- Keep project context isolated and injectable ‚Äì never assume global state.
- Model `project_profile` as both memory and persisted config to support dynamic use and versioning.
- Include project metadata in every downstream action ‚Äì it‚Äôs the basis for traceability and reuse.
- **üîÑ Coordination with WP9 Ingestion Tools**: WP9 introduces ingestion utilities (text, file, and link inputs) that often serve as the entry point into a PolicyGPT session. WP7 should extend its logic to:
    - Detect early PromptLog entries from WP9 tools and use them to seed or update the ProjectProfile
    - Attach project context (from active ProjectProfile) into WP9 tool logs and reasoning traces
    - Ensure ingestion tools can receive injected profile fields (e.g., sector, project_id) for contextual tagging or folder pathing
