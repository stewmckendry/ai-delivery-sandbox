### üì¶ Work Package Activation

**To:** `WP7Pod`

**From:** Lead Pod (via Human Lead)

**Subject:** Activate `WP7 ‚Äì Project Profile Engine`

---

### üîç Context
PolicyGPT now supports dynamic project profiles that adjust drafting and validation logic based on the context of a public infrastructure initiative. WP7 implements the engine that stores, updates, and exposes this live configuration state.

What is PolicyGPT?
- PolicyGPT is a custom GPT + toolchain designed to support government teams in drafting, editing, and finalizing gate-based documentation at the quality required for approval of multi-million dollar public programs and infrastructure.
- Discovery and system design and work package planning are complete and fully documented.  Build is in progress and being executed through a series of work packages.

### üóø Instructions
1. Review your WP scope and deliverables (system/fetchFile: `project/build/wps/WP7/WP7_definition.md`)
2. Fetch key reference files (see below)
3. Create design plan and task list. Commit to: `project/build/wps/WP7/`
4. Execute deliverables as listed.
5. Request Human Lead review and start building after approval.
6. Provide updates to Lead Pod at:
   - Kickoff confirmation
   - Midpoint progress + blockers
   - Completion and output link

### üß† Lessons Learned (from Phase 1)
- Profile should evolve over session, not be static
- Use memory + database for persistence
- Ensure tools can update and read profile mid-session

---

### üöÄ Working With the Human Lead
- Follow SOP in: `project/build/build_pods_sop.md`  
- Coordinate at plan, build, test, and final review checkpoints.
- Read message, WP definition, and reference files to get up to speed. Ask the Human Lead questions if anything is unclear.
- Generate a plan and design for WP deliverables. Include assumptions for validation and list inputs needed from Human Lead.  Create a task list to track progress.  Commit the files to `project/build/wps/WP7/` using the commit_and_log tool.
- Await Human Lead approval to begin building deliverables.
- After approval, generate all deliverables listed in the WP definition (in batches if preferred).  
- Commit files to the folders/paths listed in WP definition using the commit_and_log tool.
- Share GitHub file links in chat: `https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/blob/sandbox-curious-falcon/<path_from_root>`
- Receive Human Lead feedback or OK to proceed to test.
- If setup steps are needed, generate deploy steps and commit to `project/deploy/wps/WP7/`. Share the link.
- Human Lead runs deploy steps and reports back.
- Generate test package (plan, data, CLI scripts or GPT config). Commit to `project/test/WP7/`.
- Human Lead runs tests and reports back results.
- Generate status update for Lead Pod. Include blockers, change requests, or highlights.
