## WP7 Exit Report

### 🎯 Objectives
Establish an end-to-end service to build and persist project profiles from user inputs and utilize them across document generation workflows.

### 🛠️ Deliverables

#### ✅ New Components
- `IngestInputChain`: extracts and stores structured project profiles from raw text inputs.
- `ProjectProfileEngine`: DB interface for CRUD on project profiles.
- SQL schema and table: `project_profile` with support for optional fields.
- `storeToDrive` integration with project_id propagation.

#### ✅ Updated Components
- All test runner logic now uses `PlannerOrchestrator` for orchestration.
- All toolchains updated to accept and utilize project_profile.
- Added guards to log_tool_usage and JSON serialization.

### 🔁 E2E Flow

**1. Ingest Input**
- 📥 User submits file or text input
- 🤖 GPT: Uses `uploadFileInput` → parses into project_profile
- 📦 Tool: `IngestInputChain` saves it via `ProjectProfileEngine`

**2. Generate Section**
- 🧠 GPT: Calls `PlannerOrchestrator` with intent `generate_section`
- 📂 Loads project_profile from DB
- 📚 Tools: `memory_retrieve`, `webSearch`, `section_synthesizer`, `section_refiner`
- 💾 Saves refined section to `artifact_section`

**3. Assemble Document**
- 🧠 GPT: Calls `PlannerOrchestrator` with intent `assemble_artifact`
- 📂 Loads project_profile
- 📚 Tools: `loadSectionMetadata`, `formatSection`, `mergeSections`, `finalizeDocument`, `storeToDrive`

### 📊 Data & Schema
- `project_profile` includes fields for metadata, scope, risks, etc.
- Only `project_id` and `last_updated` are required.
- Stored in SQL, accessed by `ProjectProfileEngine`

### 🔧 Design Highlights
- Project profile is the single source of truth for project-level context.
- Profile is loaded early by Planner and passed throughout.
- Re-usable and updatable over time, improving with each GPT interaction.

### 📁 File Summary
- `app/engines/toolchains/IngestInputChain.py`: Ingest logic
- `app/engines/project_profile_engine.py`: DB interface
- `project/reference/gate_reference_v2.yaml`: Section schema
- `project/test/WP7/test_runner.py`: E2E test case

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add support for project profile versioning
- Add audit trail for changes to the profile
- Handle alternate schema versions

### 📎 Notes for GPTs and Pods
- Always access the project profile via `PlannerOrchestrator`.
- Never call `assembleArtifactChain` directly.
- Use project_profile context to tailor responses and actions.
