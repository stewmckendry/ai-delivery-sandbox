## WP7 Exit Report: Project Profile Integration

### 🎯 Objectives
To design, implement, and validate a structured project profile system that integrates with AI-driven toolchains and supports:
- Dynamic ingestion of project data
- Continuous enrichment across the lifecycle
- Reuse in document generation and reasoning flows

### 🔧 What Was Built
**New Components:**
- `IngestInputChain`: Parses raw input to build initial `project_profile`
- `ProjectProfileEngine`: Loads, saves, and merges project profiles
- `confirmProjectProfile` tool: Confirms profile with users

**Updated Components:**
- `PlannerOrchestrator`: Orchestrates ingestion, section generation, and assembly
- `generateSectionChain`: Accepts `project_profile` and stores project-linked sections
- `assembleArtifactChain`: Assembles documents with project context and Drive sync

**DB Schema:**
- `project_profile` table with optional fields for iterative growth
- Linkage to `ArtifactSection`, `Artifact`, and `web_search_log`

### 🔁 End-to-End Flow
1. **User Uploads Input** → `PlannerOrchestrator(ingest_input)`
   - Extracts text and metadata
   - Builds or merges `project_profile`
   - Saves profile

2. **User Generates Section** → `PlannerOrchestrator(generate_section)`
   - Loads latest `project_profile`
   - Calls `generateSectionChain`
   - Stores section with `project_id`

3. **User Assembles Document** → `PlannerOrchestrator(assemble_artifact)`
   - Loads `project_profile`
   - Fetches sections by `project_id`, formats, merges, uploads PDF

### 🔄 Data Flow
- `project_profile` is the single source of truth
- Updates propagate through `PlannerOrchestrator`
- Synced to DB with every major interaction

### 🛠️ Technical Design
- Profile schema: Flexible with only `project_id`, `title`, and `last_updated` as required
- SQL changes: Nullable fields, improved type handling
- JSON safety: Patched serialization issues (e.g., `datetime`, `Decimal`)

### 📁 Key Files
- `app/engines/toolchains/IngestInputChain.py`
- `app/engines/project_profile_engine.py`
- `app/engines/planner_orchestrator.py`
- `app/tools/tool_wrappers/confirmProjectProfile.py`
- `project/reference/tool_catalog.yaml`
- `project/test/WP7/test_runner.py`

### 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Versioning: Add optional `version` field to `project_profile`
- Audit Trail: Log profile changes over time
- Profile Diff Tool: Show what changed between states

### 🔍 Notes for Pods and GPTs
- Use `PlannerOrchestrator` to ensure profile context is loaded
- Prefer read-update-save pattern when enriching `project_profile`
- `project_id` must be present in `metadata` for all toolchains

🎉 **WP7 Complete. Project Profile now flows end-to-end across all major toolchains.**
