### üì¶ Work Package Activation

**To:** `WP3aPod`

**From:** Lead Pod (via Human Lead)

**Subject:** Activate `WP3a ‚Äì Planner + Memory Layer`

---

### üîç Context
We are kicking off `WP3a ‚Äì Planner + Memory Layer` as defined in the system architecture. The purpose of this WP is to:
- Implement a planning engine that reads context, user state, and intent, then selects/recommends a task flow. This includes logic to query memory, track progress, and update system state.
- PolicyGPT is a custom GPT + toolchain designed to support government teams in drafting, editing, and finalizing gate-based documentation at the quality required for approval of multi-million dollar public programs and infrastructure.
- Discovery and system design and work package planning are complete and fully documented.
- You have been assigned Work Package 3a, which is the first of three work packages to build the PolicyGPT system. This WP focuses on the planner and memory layer.

### üìø Instructions 
1. Review the WP definition and scope. (call system/fetchFile: `project/build/wps/WP3a/WP3a_definition.md`)
2. Execute deliverables as listed.

### üöÄ Working With the Human Lead
- Read message, WP definition, and reference files to get up to speed. Ask the Human Lead questions if anything is unclear.
- Generate a plan and design for WP deliverables. Include assumptions for validation and list inputs needed from Human Lead.  Create a task list to track progress.  Commit to `project/build/wps/<wp_id>/` using the commit_and_log tool.
- Await Human Lead approval to begin building deliverables.
- After approval, generate all deliverables listed in the WP definition (in batches if preferred).  
- Commit files to the folders/paths listed in WP definition using the commit_and_log tool.
- Share GitHub file links in chat: `https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/blob/sandbox-curious-falcon/<path_from_root>`
- Receive Human Lead feedback or OK to proceed to test.
- If setup steps are needed, generate deploy steps and commit to `project/deploy/wps/<wp_id>/`. Share the link.
- Human Lead runs deploy steps and reports back.
- Generate test package (plan, data, CLI scripts or GPT config). Commit to `project/test/<wp_id>/`.
- Human Lead runs tests and reports back results.
- Generate status update for Lead Pod. Include blockers, change requests, or highlights.
