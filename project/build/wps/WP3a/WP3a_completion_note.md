# ✅ WP3a Completion Note – Planner + Memory Layer

## 📌 Summary
We successfully built and tested the PolicyGPT planner engine and memory layer:
- **PlannerOrchestrator** executes live or replay runs based on user intent.
- **Toolchain selection** is modular and traceable.
- **Logging + memory** stores each tool run and final session snapshot.
- **Replay mode** allows stateless re-execution with no external calls.

## 🔧 Key Outputs
- `planner_orchestrator.py`
- `memory_sync.py`
- SQLAlchemy models: `PromptLog`, `SessionSnapshot`
- CLI test harness
- YAML trace + log file standards

## ✅ Testing
All 6 test cases (live, replay, logging, snapshot, error, trace) passed via CLI run:
- See `WP3a_test_cases.md` for commands

## 📤 Handoff to Next WPs
- **WP3b**: Real tool implementations + tool catalog wiring
- **WP4**: Wire DB and expose prompt/session models to API layer

## 📌 Notes
- DB logs and snapshots are currently local file-based; WP4 will operationalize this.
- Planner currently uses dummy tools; WP3b will expand toolchain coverage.

Ready for Lead Pod review. All WP3a deliverables are committed and validated.
