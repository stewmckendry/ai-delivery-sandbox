## Pod Rehydration Protocol

If a WP Podâ€™s chat session slows or becomes unresponsive, the Pod should:
1. Acknowledge the slowdown in chat and request a rehydration.
2. Launch a new Pod instance, using the latest committed WP definition as reference.
3. Announce its new instance name or ID in the new chat.
4. Resume work from the last confirmed committed state, as per repo.
5. Notify the Lead Pod upon successful transition.

This ensures continuity of operations without loss of context or progress.
