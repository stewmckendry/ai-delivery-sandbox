## WP ID: WP12
## WP Name: System Design Feedback Loop

### 🌟 Outcome
By the end of this WP, as a **system maintainer**, I will be able to identify, log, and act on mismatches between the implementation and system design specs in real-time. This enables a **living documentation** model where system design evolves alongside working code, reducing technical debt and improving cross-team understanding.

### 🧽 Scope
**In Scope:**
- Capturing discrepancies between implementation and system specs
- Logging design deltas as patch documents
- Updating core system files like OpenAPI, session memory, tool catalog
- Feedback from implementation tasks across Pods

**Out of Scope:**
- Authoring new features (handled by respective WPs)
- Core system architecture redesign

### 📦 Deliverables
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `project/system_design/design_patch_*.md` | Incremental design clarifications from implementation |
| (indirect) updates to `tool_catalog_v2.md`, `session_memory_model_v2.md`, etc. |

### 📄 Supporting Documentation (to generate)
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `project/build/wps/WP12/WP12_patch_log_template.md` | Template for logging spec mismatches |
| `project/build/wps/WP12/WP12_update_tracker.md` | List of updated design files and reasons |

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All mismatches from implementation are logged and resolved
- [ ] At least 2 core system files updated based on implementation feedback
- [ ] Changes traceable back to WP implementation context

### 🛠 Tasks
| Task ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| T1 | Create patch log template and update tracker |
| T2 | Monitor implementation outputs (committed files, test results, logs) for mismatches |
| T3 | Log each mismatch and associated file(s) in patch log |
| T4 | Update core system files (OpenAPI, tool catalog, session memory, etc.) |

### 📚 Reference Documentation
| File Path | Usage |
|-----------|--------|
| All `*_definition.md` files | Sources of truth to compare implementation against |
| `tool_catalog_v2.md` | Ensure tools behave as documented |
| `openapi_schema.yaml` | Update if new routes/tooling discovered |

### 📝 Notes to Development Team
- This pod is collaborative: lead by human, assisted by GPT.
- GPT can flag issues or recommend doc updates, but human will commit.
- Aim for frictionless loop: patch logs are markdown, no code changes required.

### 🔍 Clarifications
This WP is triggered dynamically during the implementation phase. Whenever a GPT pod implements a feature and detects a gap or ambiguity in the spec—such as a missing error case, undocumented parameter, or deviation in toolchain behavior—it logs it here.

**Detection Inputs:**
- Files shared by implementation pods (code, logs, outputs)
- Review feedback during build

**Action Workflow:**
1. GPT flags mismatch to Human Lead.
2. Human adds patch entry to `design_patch_*.md`.
3. GPT recommends any edits to supporting system files.
4. Human validates and commits those updates.

This loop ensures we avoid drift between spec and reality, and all future Pods inherit the most accurate design context.
