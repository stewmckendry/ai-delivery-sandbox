## 🧾 Exit Report: WP27 Iteration 5

### 🧭 Objectives
This pod was responsible for testing and finalizing the **Reference Materials and Research Tools** phase of the PolicyGPT system. The goal was to ensure that core reference alignment and research tools are fully functional across the API, cURL testing, and custom GPT interfaces.

### 🎯 Context
**PolicyGPT** is a conversational agent designed to guide users through the structured drafting, revision, and approval of public policy artifacts. It connects backend memory (SQL, Redis, Drive) with modular tools to enable a seamless, auditable workflow.

### ✅ Deliverables Completed
All of the following tools were fully tested end-to-end:

#### 📚 Reference & Research Tools (✅ Fully Tested)
- `loadCorpus`: Ingest reference docs (HTML, file upload)
- `queryCorpus`: Retrieve relevant chunks
- `listCorpus`: List all reference docs uploaded
- `alignWithReferenceDocuments`: Align question with matching documents
- `record_research`: Structured capture of user research notes

These were tested via:
- ✅ `openapi.json` schema registration
- ✅ Custom `cURL` statements
- ✅ GPT usage testing
- ✅ Deployment with persistent ChromaDB storage

#### 📜 System Utilities (✅ Tested)
- `listGPTFacingTools` (`/tools`)
- `getArtifactRequirements` (`/tools/getArtifactRequirements`)

### 🛠 Lessons Learned
- Some websites exceed GPT-4 token limits; we implemented a chunking patch for BeautifulSoup text using `chunk_text` before calling the LLM.
- Remote ChromaDB works well for persistence; key fix was aligning embedding model (1536 dims).
- Added `ssl=True` and pinned ChromaDB to `1.0.12` to fix collection errors.

### ⏭️ What’s Next
Your pod will be responsible for completing the **Input, Drafting, and Revision** phases:

#### 🔼 Upload Inputs
- `ingestInputChain` — Project-specific context (e.g., mandate letters, workshop notes)
- 🆕 **Build input review tool**: Query `PromptLog` to show all inputs uploaded so far by `session_id` and `project_id`

#### ✍️ Draft and Revise
- `generate_section_chain` — Draft policy section
- `revise_section_chain` — Review and improve section
- `saveArtifactChunks` / `fetchArtifactChunk` — Save revised chunks and retrieve them

#### 🧩 Assemble
- `assemble_artifact_chain` — Merge sections into final artifact

#### 🆕 Enhance Kickoff Flow
- Extend `getArtifactRequirements` to optionally generate and return a `project_id` and `session_id` for new GPT conversations.
  - `project_id`: user/GPT generated
  - `session_id`: auto UUID
  - This will ensure traceability from the start.
