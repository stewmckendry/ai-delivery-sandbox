## 🚦 Exit Report: WP27 Iteration 5 - PolicyGPT Reference Tools and Testing Phase

### 🎯 Objectives
The goal of this iteration was to implement and test the core tools in the "Reference Documents" and "Research" phases of PolicyGPT. This includes ensuring the tools work as expected via API, integrate correctly into the GPT user experience, and persist their state in ChromaDB.

### 📝 What is PolicyGPT
PolicyGPT is a conversational interface designed to guide public servants through the generation, revision, and approval of public policy artifacts. It integrates backend tools, memory systems (SQL, Redis, Google Drive), and a modular toolchain to provide a seamless, structured, and auditable document workflow.

This phase focused on Reference Materials, Research, and ChromaDB integration.

### ✅ Completed Deliverables
All tools below were tested via:
- ✅ OpenAPI schema updates in `tool_catalog.yaml`
- ✅ Working cURL requests to validate API endpoints
- ✅ End-to-end UX tested in the GPT
- ✅ Persisted ChromaDB storage, with embeddings correctly indexed and queryable

**Completed Tools:**
- `loadCorpus`
- `queryCorpus`
- `listCorpus`
- `alignWithReferenceDocuments`
- `record_research`

These tools are now production-ready and connected to a remote ChromaDB instance, enabling persistent reference documents across deployments.

### 🛠️ In Progress / Up Next
The next pod should continue with the following:
- 🟡 `ingestInputChain` (tool to upload project-specific inputs)
- 🟡 `generate_section_chain` (toolchain to draft policy sections)
- 🟡 `revise_section_chain` (and `saveArtifactChunks`, `fetchArtifactChunk`)
- 🟡 `assemble_artifact_chain` (finalizing the full artifact)
- 🆕 New tool to **query all uploaded inputs**, pulling from `PromptLog` by `session_id` and `project_id` so the user can verify all context before drafting sections

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Embedding mismatch (1536 vs 384) caused Chroma query failures — resolved by standardizing OpenAI embeddings
- Large input texts from URLs triggered OpenAI token rate limits — proposed chunking + fallback to `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- SSL requirement on Chroma `HttpClient` fixed persistent connection issues

### 📂 Repo Context
- **Repo**: `ai-delivery-sandbox`
- **Branch**: `sandbox-curious-falcon`
- **Exit File**: `project/build/wps/WP27b/wp27_part3_exit_report.md`

### 🚀 Next Steps for NewPod
- Pick up from Iteration 5 — continue testing input and drafting toolchains
- Build and test new "review uploaded inputs" tool
- Validate UX flow documented in `policygpt_user_flow.md`
- Proceed to full user acceptance testing

PolicyGPT is now reference-doc complete — you're ready to push forward!
