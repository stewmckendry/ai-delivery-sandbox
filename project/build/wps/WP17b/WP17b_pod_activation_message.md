### üì¶ Work Package Activation

**To:** `WP17bPod`

**From:** Lead Pod (via Human Lead)

**Subject:** Activate `WP17b ‚Äì Section Draft Generation from Inputs`

---

### üîç Context
We are kicking off `WP17b ‚Äì Section Draft Generation from Inputs`, part of the Phase 2 pipeline to transform captured user inputs into structured section drafts. This work supports modular drafting of gate documents, aligned with the `dense_artifact_generation.md` design.

You are responsible for building tools and planner logic that:
- Use `PromptLog` entries and memory embeddings
- Trigger the `compose_and_cite` toolchain
- Store results in `ArtifactSection`
- Log steps in `ReasoningTrace`

What is PolicyGPT?
- PolicyGPT is a custom GPT + toolchain designed to support government teams in drafting, editing, and finalizing gate-based documentation at the quality required for approval of multi-million dollar public programs and infrastructure.
- Discovery and system design and work package planning are complete and fully documented.  Build is in progress and being executed through a series of work packages.

### üóø Instructions
1. Review your WP scope and deliverables (system/fetchFile: `project/build/wps/WP17b/WP17b_definition.md`)
2. Fetch key reference files (see below)
3. Create design plan and task list. Commit to: `project/build/wps/WP17b/`
4. Execute deliverables as listed.
5. Request Human Lead review and start building after approval.
6. Provide updates to Lead Pod at:
   - Kickoff confirmation
   - Midpoint progress + blockers
   - Completion and output link

### üì¶ Deliverables (from WP Definition)
- `app/tools/tool_wrappers/compose_and_cite.py`
- `project/prompts/section_drafting_prompt.md`

---

### üß† Lessons Learned (from Phase 1)
- Start with a CLI-first working pipeline
- Ensure schema field alignment early
- Use Git-hosted reference data
- Keep modular tools and reusable prompts

---

### üöÄ Working With the Human Lead
- Follow SOP in: `project/build/build_pods_sop.md`  
- Coordinate at plan, build, test, and final review checkpoints.
- Read message, WP definition, and reference files to get up to speed. Ask the Human Lead questions if anything is unclear.
- Generate a plan and design for WP deliverables. Include assumptions for validation and list inputs needed from Human Lead.  Create a task list to track progress.  Commit the files to `project/build/wps/<wp_id>/` using the commit_and_log tool.
- Await Human Lead approval to begin building deliverables.
- After approval, generate all deliverables listed in the WP definition (in batches if preferred).  
- Commit files to the folders/paths listed in WP definition using the commit_and_log tool.
- Share GitHub file links in chat: `https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/blob/sandbox-curious-falcon/<path_from_root>`
- Receive Human Lead feedback or OK to proceed to test.
- If setup steps are needed, generate deploy steps and commit to `project/deploy/wps/<wp_id>/`. Share the link.
- Human Lead runs deploy steps and reports back.
- Generate test package (plan, data, CLI scripts or GPT config). Commit to `project/test/<wp_id>/`.
- Human Lead runs tests and reports back results.
- Generate status update for Lead Pod. Include blockers, change requests, or highlights.
