# üßæ WP17b Exit Report ‚Äì Section Draft Generation from Inputs

## üéØ Objective and Scope
Transform structured user inputs (e.g., PromptLog) into complete, high-quality document section drafts. This includes toolchain logic, section storage, and reasoning trace logging.

## ‚úÖ What Was Built
- `generate_section` toolchain for automated section drafting
- Tools: `memory_retrieve`, `section_synthesizer`, `section_refiner`
- Toolchain planner orchestration + intent mapping
- Save logic for `ArtifactSection` and `ReasoningTrace`
- Logging to `PromptLog`
- Full end-to-end CLI test

## üîç Spotlight: `generate_section` Toolchain

### What It Is
A 3-step modular pipeline that:
1. Pulls relevant memory from PromptLog
2. Synthesizes a first draft using OpenAI
3. Refines it for tone, clarity, grammar

### Benefits
- Accelerates content generation with traceable, high-quality drafts
- Enables consistent drafting across teams and artifacts
- Fully modular, GPT-callable, and testable

### E2E Support for PolicyGPT
- Converts user input into structured, validated draft text
- Fully integrated into the `ArtifactSection` model for review and assembly
- Logs trace steps in `ReasoningTrace`

### Technical Implementation
- Toolchain: `GenerateSectionChain` class
- Tools follow Tool class pattern
- Registered in `planner_orchestrator.py`
- Uses `memory_sync` to write outputs to DB

### Tool Process & Flow
- **Input**: `artifact`, `section`, `gate`, `session_id`, `user_id`
- **memory_retrieve**: Queries PromptLog entries
- **section_synthesizer**: Calls GPT with summarized memory
- **section_refiner**: Calls GPT again to polish output
- **Output**: JSON with `final_output`, `trace`, and `save_result`

### Supporting Files
- `generate_section_chain.py`
- `section_synthesizer.py`, `section_refiner.py`, `memory_retrieve.py`
- `memory_sync.py`, `ArtifactSection.py`, `ReasoningTrace.py`
- Test files: CLI + SQL mock

### How GPT Would Call It
Planner resolves `intent: generate_section ‚Üí GenerateSectionChain.run(inputs)`

### Reuse Guidance for Pods
- Add new toolchains to `planner_orchestrator.py`
- Follow the tool registration + manifest format
- Add test input logs, call from planner, log output and reasoning

## üîç Spotlight: Toolchain + Planner Framework

### What It Is
A centralized planner + toolchain orchestration framework that:
- Maps user intent to registered toolchains
- Serially executes each step
- Allows logging, branching, and data reuse

### Benefits
- Unifies execution across document actions
- Clean separation of logic per toolchain
- Easy to expand with new chains or tools

### Technical Implementation
- `planner_orchestrator.py ‚Üí select_tool_chain()`
- Each toolchain inherits run(input) pattern
- Each step logs output and context

### Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: intent + metadata (e.g., artifact, gate)
- Output: final result + full trace

### Supporting Files
- `planner_orchestrator.py`, `generate_section_chain.py`, `tool_registry.py`

### How GPT Would Call It
```python
planner = Planner()
result = planner.run({"intent": "generate_section", ...})
```

### Guidance for Other Pods
- Toolchains are first-class citizens ‚Äî declare them!
- Register in planner
- Reuse `Tool` class and `ToolRegistry`
