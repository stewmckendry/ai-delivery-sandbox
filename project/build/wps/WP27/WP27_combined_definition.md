## WP27 – End-to-End Experience Integration + Iterative Enhancement

### 📘 Context
The core doc generation tools and toolchains (WP17b, WP18, WP23, WP24) are complete and offer a powerful foundation. However, we haven’t yet wired them into the actual GPT interface and tested how realistic and fluid the experience is for a real-world user generating a policy gate artifact.

Tooling is well-designed but scattered across wrappers and chains. The journey a user takes from idea to document is fragmented and lacks holistic validation.

### 🚀 Mission
Create a frictionless and realistic user experience for generating policy artifacts using the existing tools and toolchains. Jam on the best UX by iteratively testing and evolving the system with real user flows and GPT integration.

This WP owns:
- Connecting the GPT interface to toolchains + tools
- Executing realistic user journeys end-to-end
- Documenting feedback, friction points, and enhancement needs
- Iterating rapidly to improve experience, accuracy, and modularity

### 🔁 Iterative Approach
Each iteration will:
1. Define a user flow
2. Choose the best toolchains + tools from the [tool_catalog.yaml](https://github.com/stewmckendry/ai-delivery-sandbox/blob/sandbox-curious-falcon/project/reference/tool_catalog.yaml)
3. Write a local test script to validate the flow
4. Configure a custom GPT with the OpenAPI schema to support it
5. Test the full user experience
6. Document feedback + enhancement needs
7. Prioritize and implement the fixes for next round

We start with a minimal journey and build outward.

### 📦 Deliverables
- Validated, connected toolchains wired into GPT
- Working end-to-end GPT experience for core user scenarios
- Iteration-by-iteration documentation (test plans, configs, feedback)
- Refined toolchains and enhancements based on testing
- Suggested improvements to the tool catalog

### 🛠️ Tasks
- [ ] Define initial user flow (e.g. start from prompt + inputs → section → document)
- [ ] Wire up toolchain in GPT using OpenAPI schema
- [ ] Write end-to-end test scripts
- [ ] Conduct testing round and log feedback
- [ ] Patch tools/toolchains as needed
- [ ] Repeat for next iteration
