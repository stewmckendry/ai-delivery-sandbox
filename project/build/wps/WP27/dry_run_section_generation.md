**Dry Run Output (Simulated)**:
> Canada’s public service delivery models face mounting pressure due to increasing complexity, rising demand, and digital expectations. Despite prior digitization efforts, access remains uneven—particularly for marginalized communities. AI presents a transformative opportunity to bridge this gap. However, adoption has been piecemeal and lacks strategic coherence. This project addresses that gap head-on by piloting equitable, AI-enhanced solutions in high-impact service areas...

## ✍️ Section 2: Desired Outcomes
**Section Metadata**:
- Purpose: Clarify what success looks like
- Intents:
  - Describe what successful resolution of the problem looks like.
  - Outline expected benefits.

**Prior Section Summary**:
- Canada’s current service systems are strained and inequitable.
- AI can fill this gap, but strategy is lacking.
- This project proposes targeted pilots to create a model for ethical AI adoption.

**Dry Run Output (Simulated)**:
> By the end of 2025, the initiative will have delivered three functioning AI pilots in frontline federal services—streamlining access, reducing manual processing, and improving citizen satisfaction. More than prototypes, these solutions aim to establish reference models for equitable AI integration aligned with GoC strategic goals. Long-term benefits include increased accessibility, greater efficiency, and enhanced public trust in government technologies.
