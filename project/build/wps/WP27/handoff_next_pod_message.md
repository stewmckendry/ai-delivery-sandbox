## 🚦 Handoff: WP27 Iteration 4 to Next ProductPod

### 🎯 Context
Welcome to WP27! You’re taking the baton from the previous ProductPod who completed Iteration 4 of the PolicyGPT experience.

PolicyGPT is a conversational interface that guides users through the generation, revision, and approval of policy artifacts. It connects backend tools and memory systems (SQL, Redis, Google Drive) to create a seamless, structured, and auditable document workflow.

---

### ✅ Completed So Far
**Iterations 1–4 are complete:**
- 🔧 Iteration 1–2: Core tools and ingestion chains
- 🧩 Iteration 3: UX logic, Redis chunking, E2E flow
- 🛠️ Iteration 4: Stakeholder feedback tools, kickoff guides, and loadCorpus+research

Everything is integrated and ready for testing. All functionality for MVP is in place.

---

### 🧭 Your Mission
You are picking up from Iteration 4. Your tasks:
- ✅ **Test** the new/revised tools and toolchains from Iteration 4
  - Tools: `section_review_feedback`, `revise_section_chain`, `record_research`, `section_review_fetcher`, `inputPromptGenerator`
  - Chains: `assemble_artifact_chain`, `generate_section_chain`, `global_context_chain`
- ✅ **Test** the complete UX flow locally (CLI/pytest) and with the custom GPT (ChatGPT).
- ✅ **Create a Custom GPT for PolicyGPT**:
  - Name, description, instructions
  - Tooling (API actions)
  - Guide users through the UX flow documented in `policygpt_user_flow.md`
- ✅ **User Acceptance Testing**: Run UAT sessions, log feedback, recommend and implement enhancements iteratively.

### 🔍 Key Reference Files
- UX Journey: `project/build/wps/WP27/policygpt_user_flow.md`
- Research tool: `record_research.py`, `search_prompts.yaml`
- Redis logic: `section_review_store.py`, `fetchArtifactChunk`, `saveArtifactChunks`
- Kickoff logic: `inputPromptGenerator.py`, `gate_reference_v2.yaml`
- All tools are registered in the Tool Catalog & Manifest.

---

### ✅ Getting Started
1. Review key tools and chains: use API fetch
2. Skim logs in `assemble_artifact_chain.py`, `generate_section_chain.py` to confirm Redis + project profile loading
3. Run test suite using `pytest` (scripts live in `project/build/wps/WP27/`)
4. Configure and test the custom ChatGPT with the documented UX flow

### 📂 Repo Info
- **Repo**: `ai-delivery-sandbox`
- **Branch**: `sandbox-curious-falcon`
- **Path**: `project/build/wps/WP27/`
- **Task_id**: `WP27-3`

### 💡 Tips from Last Pod
- Always pass `session_id`, `artifact_id`, `project_id` for traceability
- Redis stores interim results—check your keys if something seems off
- Section order follows `gate_reference_v2.yaml`
- Feedback tools store diffs + summaries for review
- Use `log_tool_usage()` to log structured data for PromptLog

Let’s make PolicyGPT amazing together. You got this 🚀
