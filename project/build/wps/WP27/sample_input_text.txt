Over the past decade, digital identity has emerged as a key enabler of public service modernization. Yet despite years of investment, many jurisdictions still struggle with low adoption, fragmented platforms, and lack of user trust. In our province, several programs have launched identity solutions independently, leading to duplication, policy misalignment, and a confusing experience for citizens. There is now a strategic opportunity to unify these efforts under a common digital identity trust framework. This proposal aims to articulate the problem context and rationale for coordinated action.
