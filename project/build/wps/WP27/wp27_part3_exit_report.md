## ✅ WP27 Part 3 Exit Report: Reference Tools Testing & Integration

### 🎯 Objective
The mission of this iteration was to validate, repair, and productionize the three `reference_document` tools in PolicyGPT:

- `loadCorpus`
- `listReferenceDocuments`
- `alignWithReferenceDocuments`

These tools enable upload, summarization, semantic indexing, and contextual recall of reference materials during drafting. They support the broader goal of grounding LLM outputs in credible, user-specified documents.

---

### 📋 Requirements
- Add persistent storage to ChromaDB instance (remote HTTP)
- Ensure embeddings are stored for semantic querying
- Fix and verify `_type` handling required by remote Chroma
- Validate curl and GPT tool interface for all three tools
- Confirm document persistence across redeploys
- Handle long document cleanup without exceeding OpenAI token limits

---

### ✅ What Was Delivered

#### 🔧 Tool Functionality
- `loadCorpus`: Cleaned up and chunked raw text from file or URL. Embedded with `OpenAIEmbeddings` and indexed in remote Chroma.
- `listReferenceDocuments`: Queries Chroma for all document metadata and deduplicates by (title, source).
- `alignWithReferenceDocuments`: Queries Chroma with semantic similarity and prompts GPT to generate a synthesized response.

#### 📦 Technical Enhancements
- Remote ChromaDB integration with persistent volume
- `_type` patch for remote collections (required for HTTP API)
- Curl test support for each tool
- Resolved model mismatch error (embedding dim 384 vs. 1536)
- Fixed GPT token overload with a `chunk_text` function
- Added defensive logging and error handling throughout

#### ✅ All Three Tools:
- Registered in `openapi.json`
- Tested via curl
- Validated in GPT UX end-to-end
- Persisted data across deployments

### 📌 Next Steps for New Pod

Welcome! You’re inheriting PolicyGPT, a structured LLM interface for authoring, revising, and aligning government policy documents. The system includes:

- ✅ Tool catalog: Modular `tool_wrappers` callable by GPT
- ✅ Chain engine: Toolchains for multi-step workflows
- ✅ Memory: Redis for session context, Chroma for reference documents, SQL/Drive for artifacts

#### 🧪 Your Tasks:
1. Review latest committed version of `loadCorpus`, `listReferenceDocuments`, `alignWithReferenceDocuments`
2. Continue testing additional tools (`record_research`, `web_search`, `saveArtifactChunks`, etc.)
3. Begin full flow tests from ingestion → drafting → assembly
4. Expand prompt tuning and test more types of reference sources
5. Harden chunk cleanup and add logging to `chat_completion_request`

#### 🧭 How We Work
Each tool goes through a 4-step flow:
1. **OpenAPI registration**: Update schema in tool class, regenerate docs
2. **Curl testing**: Print and test POST call
3. **GPT validation**: Use in ChatGPT with tool usage trace
4. **Debug & polish**: Refine UX, performance, reliability

We track each tool’s progress by stage.

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Match embedding model on both client/server (OpenAI 1536-dim)
- `_type` is mandatory for Chroma collections in HTTP mode
- gpt-4 token limits are aggressive—always chunk before calling
- `metadata`, `ids`, and `embeddings` must align exactly in length and order
- Curl is the fastest way to debug—test every tool standalone before chaining
