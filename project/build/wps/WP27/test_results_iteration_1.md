## ✅ WP27 Iteration 1 – Test Results & Debug Summary

### 🧪 Test Flow: `test_ingest_and_generate_section.py`

#### ✔ Successes:
- All toolchain steps executed without runtime errors.
- Input ingestion, intent validation, and section generation completed end-to-end.
- Logs confirm toolchain followed expected order: `upload → validate → generate section → refine`.
- Final output was syntactically valid, structurally coherent, and formatted appropriately.

### ⚠️ Issues Observed + Recommendations

#### 1. **InputChecker Output – Low Usefulness**
- **Issue**: Output is a JSON list of missing intents based on literal string match.
- **Consequence**: Doesn’t guide users on what to add, and is brittle to phrasing variations.
- **Fix Recommendation**:
  - Replace with an **LLM-powered check** using embeddings or semantic prompts.
  - Add actionable feedback per missing intent (e.g., “Consider elaborating on the strategic alignment…”).

#### 2. **Draft Content Drift**
- **Issue**: Final section draft diverged from the input theme (Digital Identity → Urban Infrastructure).
- **Consequence**: Undermines user trust in the tool’s relevance and coherence.
- **Cause Hypothesis**: Weak memory context, no strong anchor in user-uploaded input or section prompt.
- **Fix Recommendation**:
  - Force `query_prompt_generator` to echo uploaded input explicitly in prompts.
  - Integrate text extracts directly as grounding material in `section_synthesizer`.

#### 3. **Project Profile Load – Disabled for Now**
- **Issue**: ProjectProfile wasn’t loaded because profile was never saved via upload tools.
- **Fix**: Skipped for test; stub used.
- **Design Decision Needed**: Should profile be saved at upload stage or inferred from session?

#### 4. **Noisy Logs**
- **Issue**: Logs are verbose and hard to scan for step-by-step flow or errors.
- **Fix Recommendation**:
  - Add clear banners for each step (e.g., `--- STEP 3: Running Section Synthesizer ---`).
  - Reduce debug logs from LangChain/Chroma unless `--verbose` flag is used.

### 📌 Next Steps for Iteration 2
1. **Enhance InputChecker** → Use semantic checks, structured feedback.
2. **Anchor Generator to Input Text** → Pass input as grounding context.
3. **Add a Simplified Log Mode** → Cleaner step-by-step trace.
4. **Discuss Profile Strategy** → Define where and when profile gets saved or inferred.
5. **Wire GPT Frontend to Toolchain** → Validate UX from front-facing flow.
