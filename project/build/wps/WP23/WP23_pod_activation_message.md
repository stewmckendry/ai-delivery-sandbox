### 📦 Work Package Activation

**To:** `WP23Pod`

**From:** Lead Pod (via Human Lead)

**Subject:** Activate `WP23 – Artifact Refinement from Feedback`

---

### 🔍 Context
We are kicking off `WP23 – Artifact Refinement from Feedback`, part of Phase 3 to enable real-time updates to artifact sections based on user comments or new inputs. This work will allow PMs to iterate quickly and capture feedback in structured, validated updates.

---

### 🧠 Objective
Implement a feedback-to-revision toolchain (`revise_section_chain`) that:
- Detects new inputs or comments
- Maps feedback to artifact sections
- Regenerates affected content
- Logs and re-commits validated output

---

### 🗿 Instructions
1. Review scope and deliverables: `WP23_definition.md`
2. Draft plan in: `project/build/wps/WP23/WP23_toolchain_plan.md`
3. Build new tools: `feedback_mapper.py`, `section_rewriter.py`
4. Patch Planner to trigger revision chain when prompted
5. Validate integration with PromptLog, ReasoningTrace, ArtifactSection
