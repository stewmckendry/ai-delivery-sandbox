## WP18 Exit Report – Artifact Assembly and Routing

### 🎯 Objectives
WP18 aimed to build the toolchain and system capabilities needed to:
- Assemble drafted sections into complete gate artifacts.
- Validate completeness and formatting.
- Route outputs to destinations like local storage and (eventually) Google Drive.
- Prepare artifacts for consumption by GPT interfaces and reviewers.

### 🛠️ What Was Built
- `assemble_artifact` toolchain composed of 5 modular tools:
  - `loadSectionMetadata`
  - `formatSection`
  - `mergeSections`
  - `finalizeDocument`
  - `commitArtifact`
- Each tool is a validated, Pydantic-typed wrapper integrated via the ToolRegistry.
- Markdown-formatted outputs with titles, headers, and ToC.
- Database logging of `ReasoningTrace` and `DocumentVersionLog` entries.
- CLI and test harness to trigger and validate toolchain output.

### 💡 Impact / Value
- Enables generation of structured, readable, and formatted documentation.
- Bridges the gap from drafted sections to complete gate deliverables.
- Foundation for future GPT review, UX rendering, and Drive archiving.

### 🔦 Spotlight: assemble_artifact Toolchain
**Fit in E2E Flow**:
- Converts chunked, drafted `ArtifactSections` into final documents.
- Serves as output point for gate artifacts in PolicyGPT user flows.

**Trigger**:
- Called by GPT or CLI via `PlannerOrchestrator.run("assemble_artifact")`

**Returns**:
- Markdown file path and trace to GPT or user

**Sequence of Tools**:
1. `loadSectionMetadata`: fetches latest draft per section, ordered by gate reference
2. `formatSection`: wraps text with section headers
3. `mergeSections`: combines section markdown
4. `finalizeDocument`: adds title, metadata, ToC
5. `commitArtifact`: stores output locally (or to Drive in WP20)

**Data Flow & DB Updates**:
- Reads: `ArtifactSection`
- Writes: `DocumentVersionLog`, `ReasoningTrace`

**Implementation Notes**:
- Uses planner_orchestrator + toolchain registry
- Fully typed with schemas for validation
- Logging via `log_tool_usage`
- Code:
  - `app/engines/toolchains/assemble_artifact_chain.py`
  - `app/tools/tool_wrappers/*.py`
  - `app/engines/memory_sync.py`

### ☁️ Google Drive Integration Spec (for WP20)
- Replace `commitArtifact` local write with Google Drive upload.
- Return `google_doc_url`.
- Use OAuth + Drive API v3.
- Suggested file path: `/PolicyGPT/<project>/<gate>/<artifact>.md`

### 📦 GPT-Safe Document Fetch
- Avoid token/API limits:
  - Chunk by section (each with title + content)
  - Return paginated or summarized previews
- Implement via retrieval utility or memory wrapper

### 🔄 Spillovers for Future WPs
- WP20: Drive upload
- GPT interface: toolchain invocation + chunk-safe rendering
- UX/CLI: view final docs with download / Drive access
- CI Testing: integrate full chain validation

### 📚 Lessons Learned
- Templates should be dynamic to avoid redundancy.
- Jinja escaping caused hidden bugs.
- `parse_obj_as` provides better Pydantic validation.
- Value of logging early and often.

### ✅ Status
WP18 is complete and ready for handoff to WP20 + UX/GPT integration.
