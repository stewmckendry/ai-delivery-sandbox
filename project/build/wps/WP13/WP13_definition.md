## WP ID: WP13
## WP Name: Google Drive Integration Tools

### 🌟 Outcome
By the end of this WP, as a **system integrator**, I will be able to reliably store, retrieve, and query documents in Google Drive through programmatic tools. This ensures that final outputs and intermediate files are persistently accessible and organized.

### 🧽 Scope
**In Scope:**
- Save or update documents to Google Drive
- Search for documents by metadata or content
- Fetch and load documents from Google Drive

**Out of Scope:**
- End-user UI for Google Drive navigation
- OAuth / Auth flow setup (assume preconfigured credentials)

### 📦 Deliverables
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/tools/drive_commit.py` | Saves output or draft files to appropriate Google Drive folder |
| `app/tools/drive_search.py` | Searches documents stored in Drive |
| `app/tools/drive_fetch.py` | Retrieves specific documents for tool or planner use |

### 📄 Supporting Documentation (to generate)
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `project/build/wps/WP13/WP13_drive_api_usage.md` | How each function uses the Drive API, with examples |
| `project/build/wps/WP13/WP13_drive_structure.md` | Logical organization of Drive folders for artifacts, gates, and snapshots |

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Able to commit both new and updated documents
- [ ] Search returns correct document(s) given a query
- [ ] Fetch retrieves full file content
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully (e.g., 404 not found, auth errors)

### 🛠 Tasks
| Task ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| T1 | Build `drive_commit.py` to store output in correct Drive location |
| T2 | Build `drive_search.py` for querying stored documents |
| T3 | Build `drive_fetch.py` to retrieve document contents |
| T4 | Define Drive folder structure in `WP13_drive_structure.md` |
| T5 | Add planner/tool compatibility and test end-to-end |

### 📚 Reference Documentation
| File Path | Usage |
|-----------|--------|
| `data_flow_master_v2.md` | Where Google Drive is used in full system flow |
| `db_schema_notes_v2.md` | Interaction between DB logs and Drive document state |

### 📝 Notes to Development Team
- Use service account for authentication in development
- Structure Drive to reflect gate/phase hierarchy for intuitive access
- Reuse retry handler from WP4 for error resilience
