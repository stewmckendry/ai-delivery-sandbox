## WP ID: WP15
## WP Name: GitHub Integration Tools

### 📍 Status
**Placeholder** – Pending architecture decision on whether GitHub will be part of PolicyGPT's persistent memory layer and traceability system.

### 🌟 Outcome
By the end of this WP, **if adopted**, PolicyGPT will be able to export trace logs and fetch persisted memory objects directly from a GitHub repository. This supports **system traceability**, **collaborative auditing**, and **scalable long-term storage** of provenance data.

### 🧽 Scope
**In Scope:**
- Tools for writing logs and exported files to GitHub
- Fetching YAML/JSON memory objects from GitHub
- Logging commits and traceability metadata

**Out of Scope:**
- Direct code deployments or CI/CD interactions (future scope)
- Replacing SQL DB or Google Drive with GitHub

### 📦 Deliverables
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/tools/github_trace_exporter.py` | Exports reasoning traces and planner logs to GitHub with timestamped commit messages |
| `app/tools/github_memory_fetcher.py` | Retrieves project memory objects from GitHub to rehydrate GPT session memory |

### 📄 Supporting Documentation (to generate)
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `project/build/wps/WP15/WP15_arch_decision_notes.md` | Summary of decision whether GitHub should be integrated as memory layer |
| `project/build/wps/WP15/WP15_trace_export_example.md` | Sample GitHub export and commit pattern |

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub tool calls are exposed via the tool registry
- [ ] Trace files can be pushed to GitHub via `github_trace_exporter`
- [ ] Memory YAML objects can be pulled from GitHub via `github_memory_fetcher`
- [ ] Usage is logged and traceable

### 💪 Tasks
| Task ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| T1 | Implement `github_trace_exporter.py` with test harness |
| T2 | Build `github_memory_fetcher.py` with validation layer |
| T3 | Add GitHub integration config block to `tool_config.yaml` |
| T4 | Write sample trace export for testing in WP3a |

### 📚 Reference Documentation
| File Path | Usage |
|-----------|--------|
| `session_memory_model_v2.md` | Defines possible memory storage backends |
| `reasoning_trace.yaml` | Candidate export target for GitHub persistence |

### 📝 Notes to Development Team
- This integration is speculative and will depend on user confirmation
- Tools must be GitHub API-compatible, and follow secure token practices
- May involve repo access controls and branch-specific logging

### 🧠 Clarifications
- 🏠 **Project GitHub vs. App GitHub:** This WP is about wiring GitHub *as a target* within PolicyGPT, not the GitHub repo used for building PolicyGPT itself.
- 🧳 **Trace export to GitHub** is for versioned, reviewable records
- 🚀 **Memory fetch from GitHub** supports distributed memory syncing
