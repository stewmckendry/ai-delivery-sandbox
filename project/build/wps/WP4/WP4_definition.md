## WP ID: WP4
## WP Name: Gating Doc Quality Engine

### üåü Outcome
By the end of this WP, as a **quality validation engine**, I will be able to automatically check scaffolded gate document sections against required structure, completeness, and logic rules. This improves trust, reduces human error, and facilitates early feedback.

### üßΩ Scope
**In Scope:**
- Programmatic validation of gate document sections
- Logging of all validation checks
- Retry logic for flaky checks or partial content
- Capturing feedback from system and human reviewers

**Out of Scope:**
- Diffing of document versions (WP11)
- Human approval routing (WP6)
- Tool execution retries (WP3c)

### üì¶ Deliverables
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app/tools/validate_section.py` | Applies structural and logic-based validation rules to document sections. |
| `app/tools/doc_feedback_handler.py` | Logs validation issues and feedback from both system and human sources. |
| `app/utils/retry_handler.py` | Wraps flaky or rerunnable validations in retry-safe logic. |
| `app/db/models/ValidationLog.py` | Stores validation results and timestamps by section, tool, and reviewer. |

### üìÑ Supporting Documentation (to generate)
| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `project/build/wps/WP4/WP4_validation_rules.md` | Rule specs for each artifact section based on gate_reference.yaml |
| `project/build/wps/WP4/WP4_feedback_log_schema.md` | Log model structure and feedback metadata |

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validation tool runs checks based on gate metadata
- [ ] All system checks are logged to `ValidationLog`
- [ ] Retry logic supports partial/failed validations
- [ ] Feedback handler accepts input from humans and systems

### üõ† Tasks
| Task ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| T1 | Draft validation logic based on gate_reference.yaml |
| T2 | Implement `validate_section.py` rules |
| T3 | Build retry handler with exponential backoff |
| T4 | Implement `doc_feedback_handler.py` |
| T5 | Design `ValidationLog` model and test queries |

### üìö Reference Documentation
| File Path | Usage |
|-----------|--------|
| `gate_reference_v2.yaml` | Defines expected sections, rules, inputs by gate |
| `gating_doc_quality_v2.md` | Lists quality dimensions and automation goals |
| `data_flow_master_v2.md` | Shows validation step integration points |

### üìù Notes to Development Team
- Use dynamic rules that can adjust per gate or artifact type.
- Structure logs for traceability and export.
- Plan for both pre-submission validation and human feedback capture.

### üß† Clarifications
- `doc_feedback_handler.py` and `ValidationLog` will handle **both** system-generated validation feedback (from tools like `validate_section.py`) and human-provided feedback (collected during review phases, WP6/WP11).
- `validate_section.py` and the validation rule documentation (`WP4_validation_rules.md`) will be dynamically informed by `gate_reference.yaml`, allowing section-specific logic and expectations to be enforced.
