## 1. Foundational Work Packages

### 1.1 Document and Metadata Reference Layer
- Queries by gate number return correct artifact list, templates, and requirements
- Each artifact entry includes:
  - Required fields
  - Example prompts
  - Acceptance checklist
- Users can preview structure/schema before use
- Changes in YAML update tools using reference data

### 1.2 Google Drive Integration
- Files successfully commit and return a Drive URL
- Metadata includes:
  - File type (section, full doc)
  - Gate number
  - Draft status
  - User ID
- Commit logs viewable by user
- Search retrieves previous submissions by metadata tag
- Users can fetch existing file contents from Drive
- Users can retrieve a list of files within specified folder(s)

### 1.3 YAML Project Profile Engine
- Profile is created or populated from user input
- Profile data is reused across all drafting tools
- User can edit profile inline or via upload
- Changes are reflected in generated text and summaries

### 1.4 Evidence and Alignment Search
- Given a section topic, evidence results return:
  - At least 3 citations with links
  - GC-alignment tags (e.g., policy priorities, mandates)
- User can see and select which citations to include

- Returns relevant data or statistics, external research or studies, examples from other jurisdictions, and market scans
- For GC-specific searches, also returns previous GC projects and Auditor General reports

### 1.5 Token Count Utility
- Sections above 12k tokens trigger chunking
- Warnings shown to user when chunking applied
- Split sections preserve continuity and tone
- Tracks token count of the full GPT chat (prompts + responses) to monitor utilization and trigger scale-out as needed
