  title: Input Mode Handling in Custom GPT UI
  status: acknowledged
  date: 2025-05-21
  description: >
    Introduce support for dual input modes ("Guided" and "Data Dump") in GPT interface, relying on system prompt guidance and session context tagging due to UI limitations.
  linked_files:
    - project/build/wps/WP16/WP16_input_mode_CR_message.md
  impact:
    wp3a: add input_mode to SessionSnapshot schema
    wp4: ensure document assembly honors input_mode
    wp6: ensure session context aligns with mode
    gpt_config: set system prompt + starters
    wp12: assess UI toggle metaphor for clarity
  notes: >
    This change affects how sessions are initiated and guided across the system. It relies on coordinated updates in memory, UI, and GPT config.

  title: LLM-Powered Input Completeness Checker
  status: proposed
  date: 2025-05-22
  description: >
    Add an LLM-enhanced mode to the inputChecker tool that uses GPT-4 to assess clarity, completeness, and quality of user-provided inputs. It complements the current rules-based approach by flagging vague, incomplete, or misaligned answers.
  linked_files:
    - project/build/wps/WP12/WP16_llm_checker_cr_message.md
  impact:
    wp6: consider for draft validation path
    wp12: owns design patch for LLM orchestration
    wp2: potential token tracking implications
  notes: >
    Recommendation is to defer this to a follow-on WP or future enhancement. WP16 continues with rules-based checker as baseline.
