## üß≠ PolicyGPT Work Package Development Approach

This file outlines the approach for defining, tracking, and delivering build-phase work packages for PolicyGPT in a reliable and structured manner.

### ‚úÖ Hierarchical Workflow

#### Phase 1: Input Mapping (Outline Build)
1. Human Lead uploads 2‚Äì3 discovery/system_design files at a time.
2. ProductPod extracts deliverables (code and docs) and maps them to relevant WPs.
3. Each deliverable includes:
   - File path to be created or updated
   - Brief description
   - Direct reference to the source file (system_design or discovery path + relevant title or snippet)
4. Output is appended only (log style) to a structured outline.
5. No in-place edits allowed to previous entries.

#### Phase 2: Work Package Overview Assembly
6. Once all files are uploaded and processed:
   - Validate completeness
   - Deduplicate deliverables
   - Cross-reference across WPs for alignment
7. Create and commit:
   - `project/build/WPs/work_package_overview.md`
   - Contains:
     - (a) Outline of deliverables by WP
     - (b) Transposed traceability matrix from source files ‚Üí WPs

---

#### Phase 3: Work Package Definitions
8. For each WP:
   - Define outcomes, scope, deliverables (code + test), tasks, references, metadata
   - Save as `project/build/WPs/<wp_id>_definition.md`

---

#### Phase 4: Build Tracker Assembly
9. Once all WPs are defined:
   - Generate `project/build/build_phase_tracker.md`
   - Each row links to WP definition
   - Columns: WP ID, name, status, pod, links, traceability notes

---

### üîê Safeguards
- Commit each WP definition to prevent data loss
- Fetch saved WP files for safe assembly of final documents
- Use traceable anchors and append-only rules to avoid overwrite
- Log coverage of each discovery and system_design input

This approach ensures a reliable, scalable, and loss-proof rollout of the build phase.
