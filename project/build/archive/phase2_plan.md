# 📦 Phase 2 Plan: Work Package Overview Assembly

## 🎯 Objective
Consolidate all mapping logs into a single, validated, deduplicated, and optimized overview:
- (a) Deliverables grouped by Work Package
- (b) Traceability matrix: source → WP coverage

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Manual Export (Human Lead)
- **Action**: Manually copy all contents from:
  - `wp_mapping_log.md`
  - `wp_mapping_log_part2.md`
  - `wp_mapping_log_part3.md`
  - `wp_mapping_log_part4.md`
- Paste into a new file `wp_mapping_log_full_raw.md`
- Upload it here to proceed
- **Reason**: Our fetch tools face file size and batch fetch limits

---

### 🤖 Step 2: Internal Consolidation (ProductPod)
- Parse raw log into grouped structure by WP
- List deliverables with file paths + source references
- Identify duplicates or label drifts
- Propose merge strategies and WP optimizations

---

### 👀 Step 3: Review with Human Lead
- Review and confirm scope, groupings, merge decisions
- Adjust if needed to ensure logical, testable, buildable WPs

---

### 🧾 Step 4: Final Output
- Commit single file: `project/build/WPs/work_package_overview.md`
  - **Section A**: Deliverables grouped by WP
  - **Section B**: Transposed traceability matrix (source file → WP)
- Confirm all mapped content from original logs is retained

---

## ⚠️ Technical Limitations + Mitigation
| Limitation | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| File size fetch limits | Manual paste of logs |
| Lost content across commits | Append-only, validated intermediate steps |
| Git commit constraints | Final commit only when clean and validated |
| Context memory limits | One consolidation file per pass |

---

## 🧪 Feedback for PolicyGPT
This process surfaces pain points for large-scale, traceable build planning. We should:
- Build chunking and trace memory tools
- Enable dedupe + drift detection
- Introduce schema-based deliverable templates

→ **Capture these constraints and revisit** for PolicyGPT tooling design.

Ready to begin Step 2 once `wp_mapping_log_full_raw.md` is uploaded.
