gate: 1
artifacts:
  - name: Business Case
    sections:
      - section_id: rationale
        required_fields: [...]
        guidance: "State rationale..."
        example_id: bc_rationale_ex1
reference_model.md
‚Üí "ReferenceLoader must parse gate_reference.yaml into in-memory ReferenceIndex and serve section templates, prompts, and validators."
tool_catalog.md
‚Üí composeDraft, validateSection, and planner rely on section templates and guidance from the ReferenceIndex.

reasoning_trace.yaml
‚Üí YAML log includes session ID, memory snapshots, planner decisions, and tool chain steps.
reference_model.md
‚Üí "SessionMemory is accessed via each tool, linked by section_id, document_id, or user_id. Memory state drives tool invocation planning."
