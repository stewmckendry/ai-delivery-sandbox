**Scope Management Plan:**  
Any changes to the project scope will follow the Change Control process (Section 9). Scope will be monitored via deliverable completion. The WBS dictionary (see Appendix for definitions of each element) provides detailed inclusions for each component. Work not described in the WBS is considered out of scope unless formally approved.

## 3. Schedule Management 
**Project Schedule:**  
A detailed project schedule has been developed in MS Project (maintained separately). Key milestones include:

- **Gate 3 (Project Approval):** [Date] – *Achieved*.  
- **Vendor Contract Awarded:** [Date].  
- **Completion of System Design:** [Date].  
- **Core System Developed:** [Date].  
- **UAT Completed (Gate 4 readiness):** [Date].  
- **Go-Live (Production Deployment):** [Date].  
- **Project Close-Out (Gate 5):** [Date].

The timeline is illustrated below (major phases):

_Phase_ (Timeline)  
- **Planning:** Jan – Mar 2024  
- **Procurement:** Apr – Sep 2024  
- **Development & Testing:** Oct 2024 – Dec 2025  
- **Implementation (Transition):** Jan – Mar 2026  
- **Close-Out:** Apr – May 2026  

**Schedule Management and Control:**  
- The Project Manager will track progress weekly against the schedule. A buffer of 4 weeks is included for potential delays in development (contingency built into timeline).
- Schedule progress will be reported in bi-weekly status meetings. Milestone slip > 2 weeks will trigger an exception report to the Steering Committee.
- The project uses a modified Agile approach during development (iterative deliveries every 2 months). Each iteration’s completion is a minor milestone; adjustments to scope or schedule may be made between iterations with Steering Committee approval, maintaining overall end date.
- A Gantt chart is maintained (see Appendix for high-level Gantt).

## 4. Cost Management 
**Budget Baseline:** (in CAD)
- **Total Project Budget:** $2,530,000 (over FY2023-24 to FY2025-26).
- **Breakdown:** 
  - Salaries (Internal staff): $1,100,000  
  - Professional Services (Vendor contracts): $800,000  
  - Software/Hardware: $400,000  
  - Training/Change Management: $100,000  
  - Contingency: $130,000 (approx. 5% of total)

*(Breakdown can be more detailed by year if needed.)*

**Funding Source:**  
TB approval (Vote 5 capital) provides $2.0M; Departmental reference level covers $0.53M in salary. Funding confirmed in CFO letter dated [Date].

**Cost Control:**  
- The Project Manager and project finance officer will review expenditures monthly. Actuals vs budget will be tracked in the departmental financial system with a project code.
- Variance thresholds: If any budget category is expected to exceed 10% variance, or total project cost threatens to exceed $2.53M, an immediate escalation to Sponsor and CFO is required. Minor variances within contingency will be managed by the Project Manager with Sponsor awareness.
- Change requests that require additional funding must be approved by the Steering Committee and may require Treasury Board amendment if above approved limits.
- Regular financial reports (monthly) will be provided to the Steering Committee.

**Procurement Spend Timing:** (for awareness)
- Major contract (implementation vendor) – ~$600k in FY24-25, ~$200k in FY25-26.
- License renewals – $50k annually starting FY26-27 (outside project budget, handed to ops).

## 5. Quality Management 
**Quality Objectives:**  
Deliverables must meet the requirements and standards set by the business and technical stakeholders. Key quality criteria:
- New system must pass all user acceptance tests (100% of critical test cases) and meet performance standards (e.g., response time <2s for key transactions).
- Documentation (user guides, SOPs) must be complete and reviewed by end-users for clarity.
- Compliance with Government of Canada standards (Security Assessment & Authorization, WCAG 2.1 accessibility for user interface, Official Languages – bilingual interface).

**Quality Control Activities:**  
- **Requirements Sign-off:** Ensure all business requirements are clearly documented and approved by business owner (baseline for quality).
- **Design & Code Reviews:** The technical lead will conduct peer reviews of vendor deliverables at each sprint end. GC architectural standards will be applied.
- **Testing:** A test plan covers unit, integration, system, and UAT. Independent testers from outside the project team (e.g., QA team or an external QA contractor) will verify outcomes. Testing will also cover security/vulnerability scans and performance testing.
- **Defect Management:** Issues discovered in testing will be logged in a tracking tool, prioritized, and resolved before go-live (critical defects must be fixed; minor defects get a mitigation or schedule for post-launch fix).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Defined for each deliverable. For example, “Training is accepted when at least 95% of staff have attended and passed a competency quiz” or “Workflow module is accepted when it processes 1,000 transactions in test with <1% error.”

**Quality Assurance:**  
The project may engage the Department’s QA Center or an independent IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) at Gate 4 to audit readiness. They will ensure process adherence and highlight any quality gaps.

**Continual Improvement:**  
Lessons learned sessions will be held after each major phase to improve processes in the next phase (e.g., after procurement, after development). Any improvements (like better communication protocols or updated templates) will be adopted immediately.

## 6. Resource Management 
**Project Team Structure & Roles:**  
- Project Manager – **[Name]** (FT): Overall coordination, scope, schedule, budget control.
- Business Lead – **[Name]** (50% allocation): Provide business requirements, user liaison, ensures solution meets business needs.
- Technical Lead – **[Name]** (FT): Oversee technical design, vendor technical management, ensure GC IT standards compliance.
- Change Management Lead – **[Name]** (PT or FT): Implement change plan (communications, training).
- Developers – **Vendor Team**: estimated 5 developers, 2 testers from Vendor Inc. (as per contract) – work under Technical Lead oversight.
- Business Analysts – **[Names]** (2 internal, FT for first 6 months): Document requirements, processes, assist in testing.
- Subject Matter Experts – [Maybe list reps from operations who will provide input while juggling regular duties].
- etc.

A more detailed RACI is in the charter; here we ensure all needed skill sets are accounted for. The team will scale down after deployment (most contractor resources end after acceptance).

**Resource Acquisition:**  
Internal resources have been secured via [branch commitments]. Backfill arrangements for their regular duties are in place for key roles (so project team can focus). External resources will be acquired through [the vendor contract for dev/test, plus perhaps a change management consultant if needed].

**Training for Team:**  
Project-specific training (e.g., on the new technology stack) will be provided to internal team members by vendor (as knowledge transfer). Also, ensure all team members understand TBS policies relevant to the project (a briefing on GC project management/gating was done during kickoff).

**Team Communication:**  
The project team will have daily stand-up meetings (15 min) during development sprints to coordinate. A weekly full team meeting covers broader issues. Tools: using MS Teams/GCcollab for collaboration, GCdocs for document repository, etc.

**Resource Calendars & Constraints:**  
Be aware of holidays, fiscal year-end slowdowns, and respective team members’ availability. E.g., key SMEs from operations are not available in peak season (August), so schedule UAT accordingly. The project schedule has been adjusted to account for these constraints.

## 7. Communications Management 
**Stakeholder Identification:**  
Key stakeholders and their information needs:
- **Senior Executive (DG, ADM):** Want strategic updates and reassurance project is on track. We will provide quarterly briefings and an executive dashboard.
- **Steering Committee:** Will receive monthly status reports (written) and meet quarterly. Reports include progress, risks, financial status.
- **Project Team:** Daily syncs and weekly detailed meetings as mentioned (to ensure internal alignment).
- **Affected Employees (Users):** Via Change Management Plan – bi-monthly newsletters, intranet updates, and town halls before major milestones.
- **Clients/Public (if external impact):** Notify via program communications closer to launch about new service (coordinating with Communications branch).
- **Central Agencies (TBS):** If required (for Major project), quarterly reports will be submitted to TBS per Directive on Projects.

A stakeholder register (Appendix) lists all stakeholders, their interest/influence, and communication approach.

**Communication Vehicles and Frequency:**  
- **Status Report:** Bi-weekly internal status report (one-pager) to Sponsor and key team, highlighting accomplishments, next steps, issues, risks.
- **Steering Committee Deck:** Prior to each meeting, a slide deck with status, KPI updates, decisions needed will be circulated.
- **Team Kanban Board:** We maintain a visual task board (in Jira or Trello) accessible to all team members for day-to-day transparency.
- **Intranet Site:** A page on the department intranet is set up for Project X to share news, FAQs, and contact info for questions. This will be updated monthly or as milestones happen.
- **Town Halls:** Two rounds of town halls (virtual meetings) – one during design to gather input, one before launch to demonstrate the new system and answer questions.
- **Email Updates:** Targeted emails to managers in affected branches at key points (when training is scheduled, when system goes live, etc.).

**Feedback Mechanisms:**  
Communication is two-way: we have a dedicated project email for inquiries, and change champions feed back questions/concerns from staff. We’ll conduct quick pulse surveys after training and after launch to gauge how communications landed and if people felt informed.

## 8. Risk Management 
*(Summarize risk process and provide current snapshot of top risks; detailed register in Appendix.)*

**Risk Management Approach:**  
The project follows a proactive risk management process:
- The risk register is maintained by the Project Manager, updated continuously.
- Risks are identified through team brainstorming, expert input, and stakeholder feedback (ongoing).
- Each risk is assessed for probability and impact (on a 5-point scale), with a computed exposure level (Low/Med/High).
- Mitigation strategies or response plans are defined for each significant risk.
- A risk owner is assigned (team member best able to manage it).
- Risks and mitigation status are reviewed in the weekly team meeting and monthly at Steering Committee (with focus on high risks).

**Top Current Risks:** (see Appendix for full list)
1. **Procurement Delay** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* High (could delay project start). **Mitigation:** Aggressive timeline management for RFP, prepare documentation in advance, engage procurement early (Status: RFP draft completed, mitigating this risk down to Medium-Low).
2. **Technical Integration Issue** – *Probability:* Low, *Impact:* High. New system must interface with legacy database. **Mitigation:** Conduct proof-of-concept integration test early (planned in design phase); have vendor include integration expert; fallback plan to use a data export-import if live integration fails.
3. **User Adoption** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* High. (As noted, risk of staff not using new system properly.) **Mitigation:** Strong change management (see Change Plan), executive sponsorship messaging, and ample training. Early engagement of union if process changes affect job descriptions (Status: initial meetings with union reps done, no major concerns raised so far).
4. **Scope Creep** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* Medium. Users may request additional features once they see new system capabilities. **Mitigation:** Use a controlled Change Control process; prioritize a clear MVP (minimum viable product) for launch, defer nice-to-haves to future enhancements. Communicate scope boundaries clearly in every user engagement.
5. **Data Migration Quality** – *Probability:* Medium, *Impact:* Medium. Risk of data loss or errors when migrating ~100k records. **Mitigation:** Thorough mapping and cleansing of data before migration; test migrations with sample data; run parallel system for 1 month to validate data integrity.

Each of these risks has a detailed contingency plan (documented in the risk register). No risks are currently identified as “High severity, unmanaged.” The risk exposure will be continually monitored. If any risk’s impact escalates, the Steering Committee will be alerted immediately, and additional mitigation or an alternate plan will be executed.

## 9. Procurement Management 
**Procurement Summary:**  
- **Main Contract:** Implementation services for system development (vendor). Approach: Competitive RFP via PSPC. RFP issued [Date], closing [Date]. Award planned [Date]. Evaluation involves project team and procurement specialists, using Best Value to balance cost/quality. The contract will be deliverables-based, with staged payments tied to milestones (design sign-off, beta delivery, final delivery). Vendor to also provide 1-year warranty support post-implementation included in contract.
- **Software Acquisition:** The chosen solution might involve COTS software. If Option for COTS, licenses will be procured via existing Shared Services Canada Software Vehicle to save time. If custom build, this is part of vendor contract.
- **Hardware/Cloud:** Using SSC provisions – e.g., cloud infrastructure through GC Cloud Framework (already coordinated, expected to use [Azure/AWS GC enclave]). Not a direct procurement the project handles, but a request to SSC with expected lead time of 8 weeks.
- **Other Procurements:** None major. (Training services might be contracted if internal resources insufficient, up to $50k, using a supply arrangement.)

**Procurement Schedule & Responsibilities:**  
- RFP Preparation – Responsible: Project Manager & Procurement Officer (Completed by [Date]).  
- Bid Evaluation – Responsible: Evaluation Committee (Project Manager, Tech Lead, Business Lead, Procurement Advisor) – [Date range].  
- Contract Award – Responsible: Procurement Authority (Director of Procurement) – by [Date].  
- SSC Cloud Request – Responsible: Technical Lead – submit by [Date] to ensure ready by [Date].

The project has accounted for procurement lead times in the schedule (6 months for RFP to award). If any procurement is significantly delayed or fails (e.g., no suitable vendor), fallback options include using an existing TB Standing Offer or adjusting scope to in-house development (with steering committee approval if needed).

All procurement will adhere to the **Treasury Board Contracting Policy** and trade agreements. Given the estimated contract size (~$800k), proper approvals (Departmental Contract Review Committee, etc.) will be sought concurrently. 

## 10. Change Control Management 
**Change Management Process (Project Changes):**  
To control scope, schedule, and cost, any change beyond predefined tolerances will go through formal change control:
- A **Change Request (CR)** form will be used to document: description of change, reason, analysis of impacts (on scope, timeline, cost, quality, risks), and alternatives considered.
- CRs can be submitted by any project stakeholder to the Project Manager. The PM logs it and does an initial analysis with the team.
- **Impact Analysis:** The project team (with relevant leads) assesses feasibility, effort, and impact of the requested change. They categorize it as Minor (can be absorbed with existing resources/schedule) or Major (affects baseline).
- **Approval Authority:** 
  - Minor changes (no impact on overall timeline, budget, and within scope boundaries) can be approved by the Project Manager and Sponsor.
  - Major changes (e.g., adding new deliverable, >2-week schedule impact, >$50k cost impact, or affecting critical objectives) must be reviewed by the Steering Committee. If it impacts external commitments or exceeds budget authority, TB or senior management re-approval might be required.
- **Decision Logging:** Every CR decision (approved or rejected) is recorded in the change log with rationale. The project plan, scope docs, and other baselines will be updated if a change is approved.
- **Communication of Changes:** Approved changes are communicated to all stakeholders (team gets updated work plans, steering committee minutes note it, and if needed broader communication to users if scope change affects deliverables they expect).

To minimize unnecessary changes, clear scope definition and stakeholder involvement from the start is emphasized (addressing needs early). This process ensures any necessary changes are controlled and documented, preventing scope creep from undermining project success:contentReference[oaicite:157]{index=157}.

*(Note: This section refers to project change control. For organizational change management, see the separate Change Management Plan document.)*
