# Project X Business Case (Detailed)

**Project Name:** Project X – [Descriptive Title]  
**Sponsoring Department:** [Department Name]  
**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Month Day, Year]  
**Prepared by:** [Author/Team]

## 1. Executive Summary
*[Summarize the business need, the options considered, the recommended option, and key figures (cost, timeline, benefits).]*

The purpose of this business case is to recommend a solution to **[briefly state problem/opportunity]**, in order to achieve **[key outcomes]**. Three options were analyzed, including maintaining the status quo. **Option 3 ([Name]) is recommended** as it provides the best value and alignment with the organization’s strategic objectives.

- **Business Need:** [One-sentence description of problem or opportunity].  
- **Recommended Solution:** Option 3 – [name of option]. This option will [briefly how it solves the problem].  
- **Estimated Cost:** $X (total over 5 years).  
- **Expected Benefits:** [e.g., $Y in cost savings annually, improved client satisfaction by Z%, compliance with mandate, etc.].  
- **Timeline:** [e.g., 2 years implementation, with launch by FY2025-26].  
- **Key Risks:** [e.g., moderate schedule risk due to procurement; high change management risk – mitigations in place].

Decision required: *Approval to proceed with implementation of Option 3, with an expenditure authority of $X.* 

## 2. Strategic Alignment
*[Describe how the project aligns with departmental and GoC priorities, and why it’s important to do now.]*

**Mandate and Priorities:** This project supports [Department Name]’s strategic objective of _[cite objective from Departmental Plan]_. It is aligned with Government of Canada priorities, specifically _[e.g., the Digital Government initiative or Policy on Service Improvement]_. By addressing [problem], the project contributes to **[Broader outcome]** (e.g., “improved public access to services” or “internal efficiency in program delivery”), which remains a high priority.

**Context and Urgency:** [Explain background – what led to this project? Any impetus like audit findings, performance issues, or external drivers.] For example, _Recent audits have highlighted inefficiencies in the current process, resulting in service delays_. The opportunity to modernize now aligns with availability of new technology and the need to replace aging systems (the legacy system will be unsupported by 2026).

If not pursued now, **[consequences]** (e.g., “operational costs will continue to rise by ~5% annually and client satisfaction will likely decline further”). In summary, the project is **timely and necessary** to ensure the department can meet its objectives and government-wide commitments (such as [cite any relevant TB policy or directive]).

## 3. Business Needs and Outcomes
*[Explain the problem in detail and define what outcomes the project aims to achieve.]*

**Problem/Opportunity Statement:** _[Describe the core problem]_ – e.g., “Clients currently face an average 5-week turnaround for service requests due to a heavily paper-based process, leading to low satisfaction.” The process is resource-intensive and cannot meet growing demand. This presents an opportunity to leverage digital solutions to improve efficiency.

**Root Causes:** [If known, briefly mention the cause of the problem – e.g., outdated software, fragmented processes, etc.]. In this case, the root causes include **legacy IT systems**, and **manual workflow** that limits scalability:contentReference[oaicite:144]{index=144}.

**Desired Outcomes:** The project aims to achieve:
- **Outcome 1:** Reduced service turnaround time from 5 weeks to 1 week (80% improvement).
- **Outcome 2:** Improved client satisfaction by at least 20% (from survey baseline of X to Y).
- **Outcome 3:** Internal cost savings of $Z per year by streamlining processes (reallocating staff to higher-value work).
- **Outcome 4:** Compliance with [specific policy/legislation], eliminating current manual reporting steps.

These outcomes will deliver tangible benefits to Canadians (faster service) and to the department (more efficient operations). Success will be measured via KPIs such as processing time, satisfaction scores, and cost per transaction.

## 4. Options Analysis
*[Present the options considered, including status quo, with analysis of each.]*

Three viable options were identified and evaluated (along with the Status Quo for comparison):

**Option 1 – Status Quo (Do Nothing):** Continue with the current process and systems.
- **Description:** No major changes; address issues with minor tweaks only.
- **Costs:** Minimal new investment, but ongoing operating cost remains ~$X/year (staff overtime, maintenance of old system).
- **Benefits:** None beyond current state. No improvement in service times or quality.
- **Risks:** High risk of service degradation as demand grows; legacy system failure risk increases (end-of-life nearing). Does not address audit recommendations.
- **Assessment:** **Not recommended.** While cheapest in short term, it fails to meet the business need and would likely lead to continued or worsened service issues, misalignment with GoC digital goals, and eventual crisis if the system fails.

**Option 2 – Moderate Enhancement:** Implement incremental improvements to current system (e.g., partial automation) and add staffing.
- **Description:** Invest in a module to digitize some forms and hire 5 additional staff to handle increased volume.
- **Costs:** Estimated capital cost $1M (one-time) + $0.5M/yr operating (staff, maintenance).
- **Benefits:** Could reduce turnaround from 5 weeks to ~3 weeks (some process steps automated). Slight improvement in client satisfaction expected. 
- **Risks:** Medium. Some technical risk integrating new module with legacy system. Adds ongoing HR costs. Doesn’t fully eliminate manual work, so benefits are limited.
- **Assessment:** Addresses the problem partially. Turnaround improves, but not to target level; ongoing costs rise due to more staff. Might be acceptable as a short-term fix but not a sustainable long-term solution. 

**Option 3 – Digital Transformation (Recommended):** Replace the paper process with a new end-to-end digital service platform.
- **Description:** Procure or develop a modern Service Portal for online requests, with automated workflow and integration to backend databases. Phase out legacy system. Implement accompanying process changes (e.g., electronic approvals).
- **Costs:** Estimated $5M over 2 years (development/procurement, implementation) + $0.8M/year operating (licenses, cloud hosting, minor support). *See Cost-Benefit section for breakdown.* 
- **Benefits:** Turnaround time projected to drop to 1 week or less (auto-routing requests). FTE savings equivalent to $500k/year once fully implemented (staff can be reassigned from data entry to client advisory roles). Improved accuracy and tracking of requests. Aligns with GC Digital Standards (e.g., user-centric design, open-source tech).
- **Risks:** Medium-High initial risk. New IT implementation risk (mitigated by using experienced vendor and iterative development). Change management risk: significant changes for staff workflows (mitigations detailed in Change Management Plan). 
- **Assessment:** **Recommended.** This option best meets project objectives, with major improvements in service and long-term savings. It has higher upfront cost but a strong business case (NPV positive over 5 years). It modernizes the department’s service delivery, supporting strategic goals and future scalability. Risks are manageable with proper controls (as planned).

*Rationale:* Option 3 is recommended because it substantially achieves the desired outcomes (unlike Option 1) and offers greater benefits and long-term efficiency than Option 2. Although it requires higher initial investment, the return on investment is favorable by Year 3, and intangible benefits (client satisfaction, better data) further justify it.

## 5. Cost-Benefit Analysis of Recommended Option
*[Provide detailed financial analysis for the recommended option, and summarize comparison with status quo.]*

**Projected Costs (Option 3):** Total **$5.0M** over 5 years (implementation + first 3 years operation). Breakdown:
- Development/Procurement: $3.5M (FY2023-24 to FY2024-25) – includes software purchase or development costs, implementation services, project staff.
- Hardware/Infrastructure: $0.5M (one-time in FY2024-25) – for new servers or cloud setup.
- Training & Change Management: $0.2M (over two years) – dedicated funds for staff training, engagement.
- Ongoing Operations: ~$0.8M per year from FY2025-26 onward – cloud hosting, software licensing, maintenance, and minor enhancements.

**Projected Benefits:** Starting FY2025-26:
- Staff time savings worth ~$500k/year (equivalent to 10 FTEs) by eliminating manual data entry and follow-ups. These FTEs will be reassigned to other priority areas (capacity creation).
- Avoided cost of legacy system maintenance ~$200k/year (once shut down in 2026).
- Intangible: Faster turnaround could improve productivity for clients (though not directly monetized, this improves public trust and program outcomes).

**Net Present Value (NPV):** Over a 5-year horizon, NPV is approximately **+$2M** (discount rate 7%). The investment breaks even in Year 4. (Detailed cash flow analysis in Appendix A.)

**Cost-Benefit Comparison:** Compared to Status Quo (which would cost ~$7M total over same period in staffing and maintenance with no new benefits), Option 3 yields an estimated **$3M** in net savings over 5 years. Option 2 yields some savings vs Status Quo, but much less (~$1M over 5 years) and still carries higher operating costs long-term than Option 3.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** Even if benefits are 25% less than expected (e.g., only 5 FTE saved instead of 10), the NPV remains positive (~+$500k). A risk of 20% project cost overrun would delay breakeven by about 1 year, but benefits would still outweigh costs over the asset life. These analyses show the recommendation is robust financially.

## 6. Risk Assessment
*[Summarize key risks of the recommended option and how they’ll be managed.]*

The recommended project option carries some risks which will be actively managed:

- **Implementation Risk (Technology):** *Risk:* The new service platform development could encounter delays or technical issues. *Mitigation:* Adopt an agile development approach with iterative testing; engage experienced vendors with proven GC implementations; conduct architecture reviews and security assessments early. Contingency budget (~15%) set aside for unforeseen technical challenges.
- **Change Adoption Risk:** *Risk:* Employees may resist or have difficulty adapting to the new digital process, impacting benefit realization:contentReference[oaicite:145]{index=145}. *Mitigation:* Comprehensive Change Management Plan in place – including training, stakeholder engagement (see separate plan). Engaging staff in design and testing (user champions) to increase buy-in:contentReference[oaicite:146]{index=146}. Management will reinforce the change with clear communication of benefits and support.
- **Procurement Risk:** *Risk:* The RFP for a vendor might result in higher cost or protests delaying the project. *Mitigation:* Early engagement with procurement specialists (PSPC/SSC) to ensure a clear RFP and evaluation criteria; using a pre-qualified vendor list if possible to streamline. Include realistic timelines in the plan (already accounted for a 6-month procurement window).
- **Data Migration Risk:** *Risk:* Historic data might be difficult to migrate accurately to new system. *Mitigation:* Plan data migration strategy well in advance; run pilot migration tests; if needed, archive old data separately and start fresh moving forward (decision to be confirmed in design phase).
- **Benefit Shortfall Risk:** *Risk:* The expected efficiency gains (FTE savings) may not fully materialize if, for example, volume of requests increases or if staff are not reallocated. *Mitigation:* Benefits Realization Plan established – benefits will be tracked and a benefits owner (Business Director) is assigned:contentReference[oaicite:147]{index=147}. Will adjust processes to ensure efficiency gains are captured (e.g., redesign jobs to capitalize on freed time).

Overall project risk is assessed as **Medium** (per the preliminary PCRA, see Appendix B). The project team will maintain a risk register and review it bi-weekly, with major risks reported to the Steering Committee monthly. This proactive risk management aligns with Treasury Board expectations and past lessons learned on major projects.

## 7. Implementation Plan Overview
*[Describe at a high level how the project will be implemented if approved.]*

**Project Phases:** The project will be executed in the following phases:
1. **Initiation & Planning (Q1–Q2 2024):** Finalize project plan, form team, prepare procurement documents. **(Gate 3)** – Treasury Board approval obtained; detailed planning completed.
2. **Procurement & Design (Q3–Q4 2024):** Conduct RFP and award contract to solution provider by Q4. Begin requirements confirmation and solution design with vendor and key users involved.
3. **Development & Testing (Q1–Q4 2025):** Vendor builds the system in iterations. Internal project team performs iterative testing (including accessibility and security testing). UAT (User Acceptance Testing) in Q4 2025 with a pilot group of staff. Adjust as needed.
4. **Implementation (Q1 2026):** Training for all users in Jan–Feb 2026. Data migration late Feb. **(Gate 4)** – Confirm readiness for go-live (all criteria met: thorough testing, training completed, support in place):contentReference[oaicite:148]{index=148}. Launch new system in March 2026, with parallel run of old system for 1 month as backup.
5. **Close-Out (Q2 2026):** Decommission legacy system by April 2026. **(Gate 5)** – project close-out and post-implementation review by May 2026.
6. **Post-Implementation (FY 2026-27):** Benefits monitoring and support transition to operations (handled by operations team, with project team oversight for 3 months post-launch). A formal benefits review at 6 and 12 months post-launch to evaluate outcomes.

**Governance During Implementation:** The Project Steering Committee (chaired by DG of [Branch]) will meet monthly (or more frequently during critical stages) to monitor progress, resolve escalated issues, and authorize any scope/cost changes. An independent reviewer (from TBS Centre of Excellence or hired externally) will be invited at Gate 4 to validate readiness (as per the project gating plan).

**Change Management and Training:** (In brief, tie to Change Plan) All staff impacted will receive training 4-6 weeks prior to go-live, and change champions in each region will support peers through the transition. Regular communications (monthly newsletters, demos) will continue through development to keep users informed and involved.

**Procurement Strategy:** The main solution will be acquired through a competitive process (RFP) using a **Best Value** evaluation to ensure quality. This is already in progress (draft SOW prepared). Contracts will include clear deliverables and performance incentives to ensure on-time delivery. PSPC’s Procurement Branch is engaged to assist, and an industry day was held to gauge market solutions.

**Resource Plan:** The project will be delivered by a dedicated team of X FTEs from the department (mix of business analysts, IT specialists, project management) plus the vendor’s team. Additional support from corporate services (procurement, finance, HR for training coordination) is arranged. The project manager is [Name, Title], and the business lead is [Name] who heads the affected operations.

**Outcome Management:** After implementation, the responsibility for ongoing benefits tracking transitions to the business owner ([Director of Operations]). The Benefits Realization Plan outlines metrics and reporting that will continue beyond project closure to ensure sustained focus on outcomes:contentReference[oaicite:149]{index=149}.

This high-level plan demonstrates that the project is **ready to proceed** upon approval, with a clear roadmap and controls in place. Detailed project management plans (schedule, risk register, etc.) are available in the Project Plan document and will be updated continuously.

## 8. Conclusion and Recommendation
*[Conclude by re-iterating the recommendation and next steps.]*

In conclusion, implementing **Option 3 (Digital Service Transformation)** is the most advantageous path forward. It addresses the business problem effectively, aligns with strategic directions, and offers a strong return on investment with significant service improvements for Canadians. The project is well-planned with governance, risk mitigation, and change management strategies set to ensure success.

**Recommendation:** It is recommended that Treasury Board (or appropriate authority) **approve Project X to proceed** with Option 3, with a total budget of $5.0M and a planned completion by March 2026. Upon approval, the project team will immediately initiate the procurement process and formally kick off the execution phase as per the outlined plan.
