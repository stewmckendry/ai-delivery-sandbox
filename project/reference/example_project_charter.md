# Project X Charter

**Project Title:** Project X – [Short Descriptive Title]  
**Sponsoring Department:** [Dept/Agency Name]  
**Sponsor (SRO):** [Name, Title of Senior Responsible Officer]  
**Project Manager:** [Name, Title]  
**Version:** 0.1 (Preliminary Charter)  
**Date:** [Month Day, Year]

## 1. Introduction
**Project Background:**  
Project X is initiated to **[solve X problem / achieve Y opportunity]**. This initiative stems from [brief background, e.g., “the need to modernize service ABC”]. It was identified in [planning document or mandate] and is now being chartered to formally begin work.

This Charter formally authorizes Project X and outlines its objectives, scope, and governance. The project will proceed through the Treasury Board gating process, starting with this Gate 1 approval to develop a detailed Business Case and Project Plan.

**Project Objectives:**  
- **Objective 1:** [e.g., Reduce processing time by 50% for service requests].  
- **Objective 2:** [e.g., Improve compliance with policy X by implementing new controls].  
- **Objective 3:** [etc., make sure objectives are SMART where possible].

These objectives align with [Dept Name]’s strategic goals, such as _[reference specific goal if applicable]_.

## 2. Project Scope
**In Scope:**  
- Development of [new system or process] to [do what].  
- Re-engineering of [business process XYZ] in [Branch/Division].  
- Training and change management for all impacted staff (approx. N employees).  
- Integration with [related system] for data sharing.

**Out of Scope:**  
- Changes to [other process that is related but handled separately] (that will be addressed by a different initiative).  
- Upgrades to infrastructure beyond what’s needed for this project (use existing infrastructure).  
- [Any other exclusions to clarify boundaries].

This scope will be refined in the planning phase but establishes the boundaries of Project X’s mandate.

**Deliverables:** (Major Deliverables)  
1. **Deliverable 1:** [New software system] – including modules A, B, C.  
2. **Deliverable 2:** [Updated Business Process Documentation] – SOPs and manuals for the new process.  
3. **Deliverable 3:** [Training Program] delivered to all users.  
4. **Deliverable 4:** [Transition of operations/support] to the responsible team.

**Major Milestones & Gates:**  
- *Gate 2:* Business Case approval of preferred option – Target Date: **[Month Year]**.  
- *Gate 3:* Treasury Board funding approval – Target Date: **[Month Year]**.  
- *Solution Design Complete:* [Month Year].  
- *Development Complete:* [Month Year].  
- *Gate 4:* Readiness for service (UAT complete, etc.) – **[Month Year]**.  
- *Go-Live:* [Month Year].  
- *Gate 5:* Project closure (Post-Implementation Review) – **[Month Year]**.

*(The above are indicative dates; a detailed schedule will be developed.)*

## 3. Project Budget (High-Level)
The preliminary estimated budget for the project is **$X** (rough order of magnitude). This includes:
- $A for development/procurement,
- $B for internal staffing,
- $C for change management and training,
- $D contingency (~15% of total).

Funding is expected from [source, e.g., “reallocated departmental funds” or “Treasury Board submission”]. At Gate 1, funding of $Y is approved for planning phase activities (e.g., developing the business case, options analysis).

A detailed cost breakdown and funding strategy will be provided in the Business Case at Gate 2. The project will adhere to this budget unless a change is formally approved via project governance.

## 4. Assumptions and Constraints
**Assumptions:**  
- Key expertise (e.g., business analysts, IT architects) will be available from internal resources as scheduled.  
- Required funding will be approved at Gate 3 to continue beyond planning.  
- The vendor market has solutions that meet our requirements (feasibility of Option 3 is based on assumption that at least one COTS product exists for our needs).  
- Stakeholders will actively participate in requirements and testing phases.

**Constraints:**  
- Timeline constraint: The new system ideally must be operational by [Date] due to [e.g., legislative change or contract expiry of old system].  
- Regulatory: Solution must comply with Government of Canada IT security policies, Privacy Act, Official Languages Act for bilingual service.  
- Resource constraints: The team cannot exceed N full-time staff due to departmental limits; external contracting is capped at $Z without further approval.

These assumptions and constraints will be validated and monitored. Any significant changes will be addressed via the change control process.

## 5. Risks (High-Level)
Initial risk identification has been conducted:
- **Risk 1: Project complexity** – Rated High. Mitigation: Follow TBS gating and independent review guidelines; ensure experienced PM and team are in place; conduct PCRA (Preliminary rating is Medium-High).  
- **Risk 2: Adoption risk** – Medium. There is a risk that users might not adopt the new system (change resistance). Mitigation: Develop a strong Change Management Plan (see section 8) and involve users early.  
- **Risk 3: Procurement delay** – Medium. If the RFP process takes longer than expected, timeline slips. Mitigation: Start procurement prep early (already initiated); use existing procurement vehicles where possible (e.g., SSC SaaS framework).  
- **Risk 4: Scope creep** – Low/Medium. Stakeholders might attempt to add features. Mitigation: Strict scope management and steering committee oversight for any changes.

A more detailed risk register will be maintained in the Project Plan. At this stage, no risks have been identified that are deemed “unacceptable” – all are manageable with the planned strategies.

## 6. Project Governance
**Governance Structure:**  
A robust governance is established to oversee Project X:
- **Project Sponsor / Senior Responsible Owner (SRO):** [Name, Title]. The SRO is accountable for project success and will champion the project, ensuring it remains aligned with strategic objectives and securing necessary resources:contentReference[oaicite:153]{index=153}.
- **Steering Committee:** Chaired by the SRO, with members including [Director IT], [Director Operations – business owner], [CFO or delegate], and [perhaps reps from key stakeholder groups]. This committee will meet quarterly (and as needed at gate reviews) to provide guidance, approve major deliverables, and make go/no-go decisions at gates.
- **Project Manager:** [Name] (Project Management Office). The PM has authority for day-to-day project execution, decision-making within scope/time/budget tolerances, and reports to the SRO and Steering Committee. 
- **Project Team Leads:** 
  - Business Lead: [Name] – responsible for requirements and ensuring the solution meets business needs.
  - Technical Lead/Solution Architect: [Name] – responsible for technical design and build.
  - Change Management Lead: [Name] – responsible for stakeholder engagement and training (works with HR and Communications as needed).
  - etc., as applicable (QA Lead, Security Lead, etc.).
- **Independent Reviewer:** (If applicable) The project may undergo independent reviews (e.g., Gate 4 assessment) by TBS or external reviewers to provide unbiased status reports.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**  
A RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) is summarized below for key activities:
- *Project Plan development:* R = Project Manager, A = SRO, C = Team Leads, I = Steering Committee.
- *Business Case preparation:* R = Business Lead/PM, A = SRO, C = CFO (for financials), I = Steering Committee.
- *Technical Implementation:* R = Technical Lead & Vendor, A = Project Manager, C = Business Lead (on functionality), I = Steering Committee.
- *Change Management:* R = Change Lead, A = Project Manager, C = Business Lead, I = All staff (through comms).
*(Note: A detailed RACI chart will be maintained in project docs.)*

**Decision Making:**  
Day-to-day decisions are made by the Project Manager within the scope of the plan. Strategic decisions, scope changes, or issues that could impact objectives or budget beyond tolerance are escalated to the Steering Committee. The SRO has final decision authority on behalf of the department, and TB approval will be sought for any funding increases beyond original authority.

## 7. Project Organization Structure
*(An org chart can be represented in text or described.)*

- **Senior Management Sponsor:** Deputy Head or ADM – [Name] (if they oversee the SRO).
