## 🔁 Retrospective – Feature Area 2: Symptom Logging + Stage Inference

**Duration**: Completed in May 2025  
**Repo**: `ai-delivery-sandbox`  
**Branch**: `sandbox-silver-tiger`

---

### ✅ What Went Well

- **Structured Delivery Rhythm**: Started with a clear plan (`plan.md`), followed by a live task list and layered design documentation.
- **Schema-Aligned Build**: FastAPI tools, Pydantic models, YAML validation, and DB schemas all aligned with triage + symptom logic.
- **GPT-Compatible Tools**: Designed OpenAPI specs and tool contracts that ensured smooth integration with Custom GPT flows.
- **Data Persistence Shift**: Successfully pivoted from SQLite to direct Azure SQL writes using SQLAlchemy (`db_writer.py`).
- **User Flow Coverage**: Clearly mapped and documented three distinct user entry points into the system.
- **Traceability**: Maintained clear linkage from app_features → design → tools → test.
- **Thought Logging**: Captured design tradeoffs and learning moments in `manageChainOfThought`.

### 🔧 What We Built

**Core Tools**:
- `symptom_logger.py`
- `get_stage_guidance.py`

**Models & Schema**:
- `SymptomCheckIn`, `SymptomLogResult`, `TrackerState`
- `db_models.py` (SQLAlchemy), `db_writer.py` (Azure SQL integration)

**YAML Handling**:
- Reference-linked validation of symptom IDs using remote GitHub YAMLs

**Testing**:
- `test_symptom_stage_tools.py` (unit test coverage for both tools)

**Design Artifacts**:
- `plan.md`, `task_list.md`, `design.md`, `db_schema_notes.md`, `user_journey_flows.md`

### 📥 Deferred or Scoped Elsewhere

- **Symptom scoring enhancement** → FA5
- **Incident context metadata** → FA7
- **Incident-only logging tool** (`log_incident_detail`) → FA7

---

### 📚 Lessons Learned

- **Start with full user journey mapping**: It unlocked schema clarity and surfaced missing tools.
- **Avoid intermediate SQLite** when the final infra is already known.
- **Postman-first tool testing** was validated as a good approach (but not yet fully implemented).
- **TrackerMetadata** design was flexible enough to support all 3 user entry points with minimal branching logic.
