# 🧠 Retrospective – Schema Implementation Pod

## 🎯 Mission
Implement the data model and flow architecture from `data_flow_master.md`, addressing missing auditability, YAML-model alignment, and reporting clarity.

---

## ✅ What Went Well
- Delivered 5 new database models with fully aligned tools
- Unified YAML-driven schema with runtime validation (`symptom_library.py`)
- Created `symptom_log_map.yaml` and linked to `triage_map.yaml` for end-to-end continuity
- Built tools to retrieve schema (`get_symptom_log_map`) and prior symptoms (`get_linked_symptoms`)
- Cleaned up deprecated `TrackerMetadata` logic
- Audit tools (`validator.py`) and export logic now fully reflect real-world pipeline

---

## ⚠️ What Didn’t Go Well
- Initial implementation relied too heavily on `TrackerMetadata` as a catch-all
- Symptoms were stored without clear schema or validation
- Reporting tables lacked clarity (e.g., triage vs incident overlap)
- GPT tools lacked symmetry (intake vs follow-up flow)

---

## 🧩 Why These Gaps Happened
- `data_flow_master.md` was incomplete when first implementation began
- YAML and model definitions evolved independently, causing drift
- No shared symptom schema between triage and check-ins until now
- No retrieval tools for prior symptoms, making GPT follow-ups difficult

---

## 💡 What We’d Do Differently
1. **Audit the entire user → DB → reporting flow before modeling**
2. **Define YAML + model schema in parallel** to avoid drift
3. **Enforce field-level validation in all tools from day one**
4. **Add retrieval tools for all logging flows** to enable contextual follow-up
5. **Schedule a checkpoint after initial implementation** to validate structure

---

## 🪄 Outcome
A complete, modular, YAML-driven schema system with tool support for intake, check-in, and export — ready for real-world use and reporting.
