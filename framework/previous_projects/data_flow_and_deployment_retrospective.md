# 🔍 Retrospective: Data Flow Audit & Deployment Readiness

## 🎯 Goal
To complete and validate Feature 5 (Dashboard + Export) by:
- Finalizing tool orchestration and FastAPI delivery
- Auditing data lineage across triage, symptom, and export flows
- Ensuring structured schema for dashboard reporting
- Enabling Custom GPT setup
- Preparing for production deployment

---

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Built `get_triage_question.py` and `assess_concussion.py`
- Created detailed Swagger/OpenAPI spec and FastAPI `main.py`
- Logged errors and fixed:
  - Invalid `yaml` dependency (replaced with `PyYAML`)
  - Missing `uvicorn` in requirements
  - Reserved SQLAlchemy keyword `metadata`
  - Missing `TrackerMetadata` model → replaced with audit-based model

### 📘 Documentation
- Wrote and committed:
  - `deploy_guide.md` (local + Railway + Azure + Swagger + Power BI)
  - `custom_gpt_setup.md`
  - `data_flow_master.md` (canonical data audit)
  - `data_flow_tasks.md` (fix tracking)

### 🔬 Audit
- Fetched and reviewed 30+ app, model, YAML, and spec files
- Mapped user journey → triage questions → models → DB tables → dashboard
- Proposed new models: `TriageResponse`, `IncidentReport`
- Validated full coverage of YAML triage fields
- Mapped and labeled gaps, fixes, dependencies

### 📊 Reporting
- Defined Power BI views: red flags, symptom patterns, recovery stage rates
- Defined anonymization rules for cohort-based aggregation

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- YAML content must be explicitly mapped into DB fields for traceability
- Reserved keywords (like `metadata`) require preemptive checks
- GPT action APIs are only useful when they are paired with structured storage
- Data lineage must be first-class, not inferred

---

## 🪜 Next Steps
- Start new pod to implement `TriageResponse` schema
- Update `log_incident_detail.py` to log each triage Q&A
- Replace old audit addendums with `data_flow_master.md`
- Complete task list in `data_flow_tasks.md`
