# 🧪 QA + Deployment Retrospective: Schema Implementation

### ✅ What We Achieved
- Validated and updated all API routes to use the new structured schema
- Fixed DB connector (`SessionLocal`) usage across all routes and tools
- Migrated from SQLite to Azure SQL with schema modeled in SQLAlchemy
- Created and ran schema via SQL in Azure Data Studio
- Diagnosed and resolved Railway ODBC deployment issues
- Verified file export flow to Azure Blob using Storage Explorer
- Documented everything in deployment guides + addendums

---

### 🧱 What We Built
- Azure SQL: full schema, verified writes, ready for Power BI
- Azure Blob: operational summary PDF and FHIR exports
- Deployment stack: FastAPI + Railway + Docker + ODBC

---

### 🧰 Key Fixes
- `SessionLocal` imported from `database.py`, not `db_models.py`
- Added missing `pyodbc` and `azure-storage-blob` to `requirements.txt`
- Added `Dockerfile` to override Nixpacks and install ODBC drivers
- Used `nixpacks.toml` temporarily to troubleshoot system packages

---

### 🤝 Handoff
**Scope Complete.** All infrastructure and system layers are validated.

- App is deployed
- Data pipelines are writing to Azure SQL and Blob
- Schema aligned with YAML inputs and Power BI outputs

Recommend handoff to: **TestPod** or **DataPod** for analytics QA, pipeline simulation, or front-end integration.

---

### 🧠 Lessons & Suggestions
- ODBC drivers are fragile in serverless Linux — Dockerfile is safest
- Manual schema execution via SQL Studio is very effective
- Storage Explorer is a powerful but under-used admin tool
- Clear file/data structure upfront saves time in multi-step flows

---

👏 Great work across pods! System is ready for test-driven iteration.
