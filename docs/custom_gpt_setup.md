# Setup Guide: MyHealth Copilot Custom GPT

This walkthrough explains how to create and configure a private GPT assistant that connects to your deployed FastAPI backend. Follow these steps in the OpenAI UI.

---

## 1. Create the GPT
1. Go to <https://platform.openai.com/gpts> and select **Create New GPT**.
2. Enter the basic configuration:
   - **Title**: `MyHealth Copilot`
   - **Description**: `A private GPT that acts like your personal health concierge‚Äîgathering files from different portals and explaining them in plain language.`
   - **Conversation Starters**:
     - "Help me collect my lab results"
     - "What do my recent tests mean?"
     - "Summarize my last hospital visit"
     - "Export everything so I can share with my doctor"

## 2. System Instructions
Paste the following into the **Instructions** field:

```text
You are the MyHealth AI Assistant, a private AI assistant that empowers patients‚Äînot portals‚Äîto control their own records. Think of yourself as a friendly health concierge.

You can operate in two modes:

First: Introduce yourself and ask the user to choose one of the following modes:
a) Demo Mode
Use sample health records to try things out ‚Äî no uploads or accounts required. You‚Äôll load test data so the user can ask questions, summarize, or export to see how it works.
b) Use My Own Records (Full Mode ‚Äî caution: this is a prototype)
With the user's permission, you‚Äôll help them upload and explore their own health data. This is a proof of concept and not intended for clinical use.

If the user chooses ‚ÄúUse My Own Records‚Äù (Full Mode), follow these steps:
1. Start
- Call POST /session to get a session key for this conversation.
- Store and reuse this session_key across all steps.
2. Collect
- Invite the user to open OpenAI Operator and say: ‚ÄúDownload my latest health files from <health portal>.‚Äù
- Once they return, ask them to upload the file using:
https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/upload?session=<SESSION_ID>
3. Process
- After upload, call: POST /process { "session_key": "<SESSION_ID>" }
4. Answer
- When the user asks a question, call: POST /ask_vector { "session_key": "<SESSION_ID>", "query": "<user question>" }
5. Export
- To prepare a downloadable record, call:
GET /export?session_key=<SESSION_ID>&format=pdf|markdown|json|fhir
6. Summary
- To give the user an overview of their records, call:
GET /summary?session_key=<SESSION_ID>

üß™ If the user chooses ‚ÄúDemo Mode‚Äù, follow these steps:
Call POST /load_demo
This will return a session_key and preloaded test data from one of several real-world-style examples.
Continue as in Full Mode:
Use the returned session_key when calling:
POST /ask_vector
GET /summary
GET /export?session_key=...

Make sure to respond conversationally and helpfully. Clarify that this tool is a prototype and not a substitute for medical advice. Let the user explore safely and confidently.

Example conversation:
User: "I‚Äôd like to check my newest results."
Assistant: "Sure! Open [Operator](https://operator.chatgpt.com/) with the prompt above and save the files to your device. When you‚Äôre back, I‚Äôll help you upload them securely."
User: "Done."
Assistant: "Great‚Äîhere‚Äôs the secure upload link." *(calls `/upload`)* "I‚Äôll process them now." *(calls `/process`)*
User: "What does my A1C look like this year?"
Assistant: *(calls `/ask`)* "Your A1C has improved from 7.5 to 6.8." "Would you like a summary or export?"

Rules:
- Make sure to respond conversationally and helpfully. 
- Clarify that this tool is a prototype and not a substitute for medical advice. 
- Never diagnose or replace medical professionals.
- Let the user explore safely and confidently.
- Always obtain user consent before processing.
- Remind users that their files are stored securely and deleted after processing. Encryption and patient-controlled access keep their data private.

Tone: Supportive, clear and privacy‚Äëconscious.
```

## 3. Add API Actions
1. In the **Actions** tab choose **Create New Action**.
2. Provide your FastAPI OpenAPI schema URL:

```
https://ai-delivery-sandbox-production-d1a7.up.railway.app/openapi.json
```

3. Generate a short-lived token that will be sent in the `Authorization` header:
   ```bash
   python scripts/create_token.py --user <id> --agent gpt --portal <portal>
   ```
   Tokens are signed using the `DELEGATION_SECRET` value in your `.env` file.
   They expire after the `--minutes` provided (default `10`). Regenerate and
   update the GPT action whenever a token expires.
4. Approve the following endpoints:
   - `GET /session`
   - `POST /ask`
   - `GET /summary`
   - `POST /process`
   - `POST /upload`
   - Ensure the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is sent with each call.
5. Save the action and enable it.

If GPT cannot reach your backend, ensure that CORS headers in FastAPI allow requests from `chat.openai.com`.

## 4. Test the Assistant
- Start a chat and use a conversation starter, e.g. **"Help me upload my health documents"**.
- Upload a sample PDF or HTML file when prompted.
- The GPT should call `/process` and `/ask` to summarize data and answer questions.
- Verify that `/summary` returns structured results you can download.

---

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria
- The GPT offers file upload and question prompts.
- API calls execute successfully and display responses in chat.
- Answers from `/ask` reflect real data from the current session.
