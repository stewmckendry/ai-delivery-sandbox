  output_summary: Over the past decade, digital identity has emerged as a key enabler
    of public service modernization. Yet despite years of investment, many jurisdictions
    still struggle with low adoption, fragmented platforms, and lack of user trust.
    In our province, several programs have launched identity solutions independently,
    leading to duplication, policy misalignment, and a confusing experience for citizens.
    There is now a strategic opportunity to unify these efforts under a common digital
    identity trust framework. This proposal aims to articulate the problem context
    and rationale for coordinated action.
