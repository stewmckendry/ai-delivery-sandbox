  output_summary: "Canadian cities are facing increasing climate risks such as heatwaves,\
    \ flooding, and air pollution. Urban green infrastructure (UGI) \u2014 including\
    \ parks, green roofs, rain gardens, and tree canopies \u2014 offers a resilient\
    \ approach to mitigate these risks. Studies highlight how UGI enhances stormwater\
    \ management, lowers urban temperatures, and improves public health (Toronto Environment\
    \ Office, 2022; Green Cities Canada, 2023).\n\nJurisdictions like Vancouver and\
    \ Montreal are investing heavily in UGI to meet climate targets and improve quality\
    \ of life. Federal policies such as the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth\
    \ and Climate Change encourage municipalities to integrate green infrastructure\
    \ in long-term planning. Moreover, interdisciplinary research suggests that equitable\
    \ access to UGI contributes to social resilience, particularly in low-income neighborhoods\
    \ (McArthur & Stewart, 2021).\n\nInvestment in UGI should prioritize high-risk\
    \ urban areas, align with community engagement strategie"
